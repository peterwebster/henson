note519	"Lord Buckmaster had introduced a divorce bill in the House of Lords in March 1920 in the face of the Church's continued opposition to divorce on grounds other than adultery. The new grounds it proposed included habitual drunkeness, cruelty, and permanent insanity. The archbishops opposed the bill, Lang arguing that public welfare did not permit an extension, and Davidson that the 'spiritual' and 'physical' aspects of marriage were inseparable; divorce on 'spiritual' grounds only would lead to divorce by mutual consent. On 4 May, anticipating the bill's passage and prompted by a letter from Gore on 25 April, Davidson moved an amendment in the committee stage that would make remarriage in church by either party to a divorce under the act illegal.The amendment failed by one vote. The Lords passed the bill on 22 June, but it was defeated in the Commons."	""  
note520	"Henson wrote to George Nimmins of the 'great excitement' of Asquith's victory, which he thought was widely welcomed, partly because of a sense that Parliament had suffered from his exclusion, and partly because he had not been fairly treated. He also noted that the Coalition candidate lost his deposit, so badly did he poll: Henson to Nimmins, 28 Feb. 1920."	""  
note521	"The Fisher Education Act of 1918 made central government responsible for 60% of teachers' salaries, and local authorities 40%. This enabled teachers' salaries to be raised, along with their status, following a long-running campaign by the teaching profession. The salary increase applied only to teachers in state schools, not in independent schools, where salaries remained low, and pensions - also established for state school teachers in the Act - non-existent."

note530	"Prompted by Archbishop Davidson, Lord Gorell introduced a new Matrimonial Causes Bill into the House of Lords in March 1921. This limited divorce law reform to the agreed recommendations of both the majority and minority members of the Royal Commission in 1912: making existing divorce law more accessible, particularly to women. However, Lord Buckmaster moved an amendment at the committee stage, extending the grounds for divorce to desertion for three years by either party. He thereafter became the sponsor of the bill, which eventually passed in the Lords but was rejected in the Commons, which had also just rejected another divorce bill."	""
