<p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> prints my letter on its front page under the heading '</hi><hi rend="underline">The faith of the Sovereign' Catholic Allegiance to Elizabeth. Reply to Cardinal Bourne</hi><hi>.' It reads better than I expected, though whether it was worth while writing it I doubt.</hi>

<p><hi>Lionel &amp; I motored to Durham, where I instituted and licenced 8 clergymen in the Castle, and then lunched with Wilson. Then I had an interview in the Chapter Office with Probert from Winlaton. When he had gone, I was photographed by Edis. Then we motored to Deaf Hill, where I confirmed 60 candidates. We had tea with Wilkinson, the Vicar of Chilton: after which I confirmed a sick woman privately. Then we went to Lomax's largest church, an exâ€“skating rink, where I confirmed 175 persons in a stifling atmosphere. After the service we returned to Auckland.</hi>
