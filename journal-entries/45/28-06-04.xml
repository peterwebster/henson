         </p>
<p><hi>I baptized </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Elizabeth Jean Linnell</hi><hi> in S. Anne's. Gerald Linnell<persName xml:id="5468"></persName> &amp; his wife were there, also his brother–in–law, the Archbishop of Sydney &amp; </hi><hi rend="underline">his</hi><hi> wife, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Linnell senior. Also M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Wilson from Burnopfield with Peter. They all had lunch at the Castle after the ceremony.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I motored to Silksworth, where I preached to the members of the Mothers' Union from the Rural Deanery. They crowded the church into which many were quite unable to gain entrance. I preached a poor little sermon from notes which I had prepared on the mistaken supposition that I was to address an open–air gathering. Then Petrie, the Vicar of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Barnabas, Sunderland, carried me off to confirm a husband &amp; wife privately. This ended, we returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">Burkitt has rather a 'waspish' letter in the</hi> 
<hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="bold underline">ostensibly designed to 'answer' my review of "Fix": but in fact having small relation thereto. He refers to what he is pleased to call my "notorious sermon" at Cambridge</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> Very hastily I wrote and sent off a short reply. Probably I should have been wiser to let it alone.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The weather has become quite cold again, &amp; there are threatenings of rain.</hi>
