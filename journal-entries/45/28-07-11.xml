<p><hi>I left the castle about 7.50 a.m. and motored to York via Darlington &amp; Northallerton, arriving at S. William's College at 9.40 a.m. 62 miles in 1 hour &amp; 50 minutes is quite a good pace for "safety first"!</hi>

<p><hi>There was no business of the slightest importance, and we got through it by lunch&#8211;time. I lunched with my Brethren in the Archbishop's room, &amp; then went into the Cathedral. A large body of schoolboys from Horden were being shown round. I went to Bishopthorpe with the Archbishop &amp; the Bishop of Sheffield. We sate in the garden &amp; talked. I was much delighted with the beauty of his Grace's flowers. The delphiniums especially were delightful. After dining at Bishopthorpe, I went to the station, &amp; met Ella who was returning from London. We drove back to Auckland arriving about 11.45 p.m.</hi>

<p><hi rend="italic bold underline">'Punch' had a ridiculous drawing of me as a chess bishop standing by my Castle, &amp; holding out a plate for contributions. The financial result of all this publicity is almost nothing</hi><hi rend="italic">, &amp; I am completely baffled by the invincible indifference of the public, which either doesn't credit the necessity, or doesn't really care what happens to the Castle.</hi>
