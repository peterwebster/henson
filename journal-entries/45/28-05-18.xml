         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Macdonald</hi><hi>, the 'Rescue Worker', had an interview with me. She had been perturbed by my veto on work with men &amp; boys! But I don't think she will do much harm, &amp; she repudiates the public meetings in which </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Maud</hi><hi> evidently exults!</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="underline">Spectator</hi><hi> contains a review of Judge </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lindsey'</hi><hi>s '</hi><hi rend="underline">Companionate Marriage'</hi><hi>, disconcertingly favourable.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> motored me to Leadgate, where I confirmed about 100 persons. The old vicar, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Coney</hi><hi>, is almost imbecile, but notwithstanding this circumstance, or perhaps in consequence of it, he has just married an elderly widow! Happily the Rural Dean was present, so that I was able to transfer to him the share in the service which is commonly applied to the Incumbent. The service was reverent &amp; well ordered: for this the credit must be assigned to the curate, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Woodward</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I read through a tract by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh Walpole</hi><hi>, '</hi><hi rend="underline">My religious Experience'</hi><hi>, published in the series '</hi><hi rend="underline">Affirmations</hi><hi>' published by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Ernest Benn</hi><hi>, &amp; edited by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Percy Dearmer</hi><hi>. The editor is assisted by "</hi><hi rend="underline">a small committee of which D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> David, Bishop of Liverpool is Chairman".</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Walpole</hi><hi>'s tract is autobiographical, and includes a very hostile description of a Cathedral City, which can easily, and will be generally, recognized as Durham.</hi>
