<p><hi>A damp thunderous day, very depressing. I basely 'cried off' the gathering of Girl Guides at Lumley Castle, but the three ladies went. Ella talked to Princess Mary instead of me, without doubt to the advantage of both.</hi>

The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Chronicle</hi><hi rend="italic"> a 'progressive&#8211;liberal' organ of the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Protestant Episcopal Church</hi><hi rend="italic"> in America has something like an attack on the Bishop of Durham in its article on 'English Church Life'.

In a divided Church like ours only thorough&#8211;going partisans could satisfy them, and if anything be certainly true about me, it is that I never have been, and never can be a partisan. Nature has stamped me as a born 'mugwump'!</hi>
