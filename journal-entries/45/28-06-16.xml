<p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, June 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>

         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">James Parker&#8211;Smith</hi><hi> sends me an interesting account of the debate in the House of Commons, at which he was present almost throughout:</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>"It was clear that the Protestant drum had been sounded loud enough to frighten the man in the street whether Church or Dissenter, that the opponents were thoroughly keen &amp; in earnest, &amp;, I think that the supporters were a good deal frightened as to what they would find to be the opinion of their constituents." </hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>This agrees with the opinion of the Parliamentary Correspondent of the Times:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>"All the oratory in the world could hardly have carried it (i.e. the Measure) against a curious alliance of extremists on both wings of the Church, which drew support also from a vague resentment at the growth of lawlessness in certain dioceses in recent years and </hi><hi rend="underline">from an element in the House which is disposed to vote against any form of constituted authority.</hi><hi>"</hi> 
         </p>
<p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Labour Party may take credit for defeating the Book</hi><hi>, for if it had abstained from voting, there would have been a majority of 1 for the Book. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">If the "Celtic fringe" had abstained, &amp; England alone had voted, there would have been a majority of 11 for the Book (208 to 197).</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">[92] </hi><hi>[symbol]</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">Some reflections are suggested by the division which are not unimportant:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>1.</hi><hi rend="underline"> The extreme unpopularity of the Anglo&#8211;Catholick version of Anglicanism.</hi><hi> Nobody on either side was moved to say a word in its favour. The only point was whether the new Prayer Book was, or was not, an effective instrument for restraining it.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>2. </hi><hi rend="underline">The strength of the 'No Popery ' frenzy.</hi><hi> Neither the education of the people, nor the prevalence of secularism has destroyed this sentiment. It is still a force to be reckoned with in the political world.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>3. </hi><hi rend="underline">The unpopularity of the Bishops.</hi><hi> No credit was given to episcopal assurances. No consideration was shown for episcopal feelings. The Bench was treated with open contempt.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>4. </hi><hi rend="underline">The almost total absence of any conception of the Church as a spiritual society. </hi><hi>Nobody seemed to realize the grotesqueness of the assumption, on which the majority voted, that </hi><hi rend="bold underline">the government of an episcopal church should be taken out of the hands of the Episcopate.</hi><hi> It seemed to be taken for granted that the Bishops both could and would "take it lying down", and meekly obey the orders of the House of Commons.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">[92][sic] </hi><hi>[symbol]</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote a short sermon for use at the dedication of the Seamen's Church in Sunderland. In the afternoon I walked round the Park, basely avoiding the invasion of Gateshead people, who came to hold service in the Chapel, &amp; disport themselves in the Park. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Wood</hi><hi> from Newcastle was their preacher. He came to me in my study, and talked about the crisis in the Church, of which, I think, he hardly perceives the gravity.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I received from the Author, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Robert Donald G.B.E.</hi><hi>, a copy of his book, "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Tragedy of Trianon, Hungary's Appeal to Humanity</hi><hi>". There is an </hi><hi rend="underline">Introduction</hi><hi> by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Viscount Rothermere</hi><hi>, which has the effect of destroying confidence in the good faith of the writer.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The only two bishops who comment on the rejection of the Revised Prayer Book in the newspapers are the inevitable windbags &#8211; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Frodsham </hi><hi>and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Welldon</hi><hi>. There are some foolish opinions vented by Lord Wolmer, and a rather indiscreet letter in the Times from his father.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Fisher Ferguson</hi><hi rend="italic"> is reported to have caused the bell of the parish church at Collierley to be rung when the news of the voting arrived about 11.30 p.m., and to have held a service of Thanksgiving for the crowning mercy!!</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>His oath of canonical obedience doesn't mitigate his manners!</hi>
