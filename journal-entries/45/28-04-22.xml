<p><hi>Summer time has begun. The clocks were put forward last night, and we go to our duties this morning in the spirit of resolute make&#8211;belief which befits the occasion, &amp; counteracts our semi&#8211;somnolence. It is a calm morning, but chilly and with a clouded sky, probably prophetic of yet more rain.</hi>

<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 9 communicants including John.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Blundell</hi><hi>, the Papist, explaining my view of his martyred ancestors as the </hi><hi rend="underline">political</hi><hi> victims of their own </hi><hi rend="underline">religious </hi><hi>leaders, a view as unassailable as it must needs be unpleasant.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I walked round the Park after the gates had been closed, and noticed with alarm a considerable breach in the wall. These stone walls are extremely loose in texture: once they begin to crumble, they come to speedy ruin.</hi>

<p><hi>I am informed that the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> J.R. Gardiner</hi><hi>, Rector of Rokeby, has received preferment somewhere in the south. This is the clergyman concerning whom there was some difficulty with the Headmaster of Barnard Castle School. I remember sending the Headmaster to the Bishop of Ripon, who at that time was D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Strong.</hi>
