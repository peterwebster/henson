<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8. A.m. The communicants numbered 19 including Elland with his wife &amp; daughter, the 4 Brydens, John, &amp; Major Stafford.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>After breakfast I motored to Burnopfield where I preached &amp; celebrated, Linnell<persName xml:id="5468"></persName> read Mattins &amp; assisted at the Holy Communion. There were about fifty communicants. I lunched with Wilson &amp; his wife, and rested afterwards. Then I motored to Sunderland, &amp; had tea with old Pater &amp; his family – a most melancholy group illustrating decrepitude &amp; sanctity in combination! Then I went on to Ryhope where I preached in the parish church. The garrulity of the Vicar increases, &amp; his nerves are unstable. After this, I returned to Auckland. The roads were less crowded with cars than I had expected.</hi>

<p><hi>Pater said that a great part of his parish, &amp; also of Jackson's was condemned to demolition as slum property: that this demolition would reduce considerably the number of parishioners: &amp; that his successor would have an uncomfortable time for several years, i.e. until the parish had been rebuilt. The gloom of the Rectory, &amp; the squalor of the streets which surround it are dreadful. The great Hanoverian parish church is a blend of sepulchre &amp; white elephant!!</hi>
