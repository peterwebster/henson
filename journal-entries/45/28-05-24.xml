<p><hi>I spent the morning in writing a review of "Jix's" book, which I had read through before</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>going to bed last night. It was designedly severe in order to express my feelings &amp; satisfy </hi>
         </p>

For the proper understanding of this, the most ancient, yet still so vigorous international power, it is above all necessary fully to understand her historical development".</hi>
