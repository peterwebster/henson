         </p>
<p><hi>A glorious day, not too warm &amp; with no wind. Everything quite perfect. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8.15 a.m.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I motored to Darlington, and lunched with the Mayor and Corporation in the Queen's Hall. After lunch the whole company proceeded to the 'Walker Homes for the Aged Poor' which were formally 'opened' by the Marchioness of Aberdeen. I read a prayer which I had written for the occasion. There was an immense gathering of the Townsfolk. As soon as the function was over, I returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I motored to Durham, &amp; presided at a meeting of the Lightfoot Trustees. It appears that the sale of the great commentaries is falling off. Liverpool is following Westcott into the limbo of obsoletism! I dined with the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; then went to the Chapter Office, &amp; witnessed the legal business. Before Ferens administered the statutory declaration &amp; oath of allegiance I spoke earnestly to the candidates, emphasizing the moral responsibility involved in their action. Then we all went to the Deanery Chapel where I delivered the charge which I had prepared.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>After this I returned to Auckland, feeling sufficiently fatigued.</hi>
