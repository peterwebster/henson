         </p>
<p><hi>A warm night followed by a bright morning. The trees are fully clothed, &amp; the 'leafy month of June' merits the description.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered altogether 12 communicants, including Lionel and the four Brydens.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Then I wrote letters to the following:–</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>1. The Bishop of Oxford, enclosing a copy of my proposed Resolution, &amp; also a copy of Lord Phillimore's letter.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>2. To Henry Peile, about the Castle.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>3. To Lord Scarbrough, about the Castle in the H. of L.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>4. To Di Darling ) about getting an audience</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>5. To M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Inge ) together in the Mansion House</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>6. To D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Fleming ) on July 23</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>At 3 p.m. I administered Confirmation in the Chapel. About 80 candidates were presented from various parishes. Braley<persName xml:id="5464"></persName> brought about 8 students from Bede College: &amp; the Missions to Seamen chaplain presented a young sailor. A good many clergy &amp; candidates came in to tea afterwards. The Chapel seemed to be filled with candidates &amp; their friends. I spoke from Acts xi. 26. "</hi><hi rend="underline">The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch</hi><hi>."</hi>

<p><hi>["]With the truth of Church of England doctrines or principles the House of Commons has no concern. It is not a branch of any church, divided or undivided: and it would be frankly unbearable were an assembly so constituted to express any opinion as to the Truth or falsehood of any article of </hi><hi rend="bold underline">religion</hi><hi>.</hi>["]

         </p>
<p><hi>Ella accompanied me to South Shields, where I preached at Evensong in S. Michael's Church, South Westoe. There was a very large congregation in which I observed with much satisfaction were many young men. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Shaddick</hi><hi> has </hi><hi rend="italic">two curates –</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"> Woods</hi><hi rend="italic"> and </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Wright</hi><hi rend="italic"> – and all three are comparatively young men. Shaddick was ordained in 1910: Woods in 1922: Wright in 1927. Youth draws to youth. Of all the conditions unfavourable to the church's efficiency in these industrial districts, perhaps the seniority of the clergy is the most potent. It has a withering effect on every part of the parochial life, killing enthusiasm, discouraging initiative, &amp; creating a querulous &amp; despondent</hi><hi> atmosphere &amp; habit in church &amp; parish.</hi>
