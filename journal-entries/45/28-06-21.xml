<p><hi>Lionel accompanied me to the station at Darlington where I caught the early train to King's Cross, and travelled comfortably enough. After leaving my bags in Park Lane, I walked to the hairdresser &amp; was only trimmed. Then I went to Sackville Street, and ordered a new suit of clothes. I walked to Westminster, and went to the House of Lords, which was just dispersing. I saw </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Salisbury</hi><hi> for a minute: gave in my notice about Durham Castle for Tuesday, the 3</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi><hi>. July: walked with </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Lords Phillimore &amp; Darling</hi><hi>, and wrote to Ella. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Farrer, one of the officials, as I suppose, spoke to me about Bishop Tunstall, who, he said, was his ancestor. He said that he had some prints which he w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi>. like me to see. I told him to lay hold of me when I next came into the House. Then, as I left the House, I fell in with the </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Charnwoods</hi><hi>. I called at the Deanery, Westminster, and had tea and talk with the Dean and </hi><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Norris</hi><hi>. Then I walked to the Athenaeum, where I talked with </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Sumner</hi><hi>, and </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Archie Fleming</hi><hi rend="bold">, </hi><hi>who took me off to dine with his wife &amp; family. I walked back to Park Lane.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">[99]</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Wolmer</hi><hi> sends me a pamphlet that he has written about the Church of Scotland, which he accompanies with a letter. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">In it he offers amends for the very insulting language which he used about me when I was first nominated to a bishoprick</hi><hi>:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"In sending you this pamphlet, may I repeat with what admiration I have followed your attitude on the Prayer Book question. I feel greatly ashamed of every having doubted that you would not fail the Church in the hour of crisis. I must humbly ask your forgiveness in that respect and in others.</hi><hi>"</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">That is generous language, &amp; must have cost him some sacrifice of pride to write.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Davenport</hi><hi> hastened across the House of Lords to speak to me. I thought he had something urgent to say, but </hi><hi rend="bold underline">it was only to ask me not to refuse the Archbishoprick of York</hi><hi>!!! "</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Wait till she asks you, Sir, she said</hi><hi>!" was my inevitable reply. What an ass the man is! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Lady Charnwood</hi><hi> started on the same tack, then she is, like Voltaire's Abbakuk, 'capable de tout'!</hi>
