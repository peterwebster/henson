<p><hi>I wrote to Lord Phillimore sending him a copy of the draught resolution which I had sent to the Archbishop.

<p><hi rend="italic">I dined with Lord Darling. Lord Iddesleigh was the only other guest. He is a quaint little white&#8211;headed man, who has become a Papist, but talks intelligently. He said that he had been for two years in America as a schoolmaster, and had formed the lowest estimate of American morals. His description of the "petting parties" to which he was invited accords with Judge Lindsey's account of American fashions. I was back in Park Lane by 10 p.m.</hi>
