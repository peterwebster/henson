<p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, May 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>[symbol]</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote to the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Prime Minister</hi><hi> begging him to be our </hi><hi rend="underline">Mercurius </hi><hi>or Chief Speaker at the Mansion House Meeting for the Castle Fund.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Master of Balliol</hi><hi> having written to ask </hi><hi rend="italic">me to support </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Grey's</hi><hi rend="italic"> candidature for the Oxford Chancellorship, which has been vacated by the regrettable death of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Ian Cave</hi><hi rend="italic">, I told him that, since there was to be a contest </hi><hi rend="i bold">on the usual party lines</hi><hi rend="italic">, in which he would probably be defeated, I would not join his Committee. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Salisbury</hi><hi rend="italic">, who is suggested as the Conservative candidate, would do well enough.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Knyvett</hi><hi> and his wife, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Linnell</hi><hi>, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi><hi> were at lunch, as well as </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Dillon</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> and I motored to Esh, where I "Colessed" the whole new school, and then confirmed 25 persons in the little parish church. This was the last appearance of the Vicar, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">the Rev. W. Firth</hi><hi>, who has held the living for 19 years. This benefice is in the gift of the Bishop of Manchester. It is credited with a net income of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">&#x00A3;400</hi><hi>, but, as Firth takes a pension, the new incumbent will have no more than &#x00A3;300. There is a large Vicarage&#8211;house, with a good deal of ground attached to it. So my Brother of Manchester will not find it easy to find a suitable man.</hi>
