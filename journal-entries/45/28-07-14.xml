<p><hi>The wonderful hot weather continues, &amp; though rather exhausting, is most delightful. I wrote personal appeals for Durham Castle to Lord Melchet (Sir Alfred Mund), Sir John Ropner, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Webster. Also I wrote yet another begging letter to the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Times</hi><hi>.</hi>

<p><hi>I revised the old sermons which I have selected for use tomorrow.</hi>

Jimmie writes to me from Sunderland to say that everybody is agreed that I must go to Lambeth!!! </hi><hi>Everybody means, of course, the evening paper!!</hi>
