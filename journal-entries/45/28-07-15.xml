<p><hi>A brilliant morning. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 8 com</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi><hi>., including one guest. After breakfast Lionel and I motored to Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street, where I preached at Mattins in the parish church. The Duke and Duchess of York attended the service. They were accompanied by Lord &amp; Lady Scarbrough, with whom they are staying while they fulfil a number of public engagements in the locality. After service the party were shown the Church, &amp; we went back to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The Church Lads Brigade, to the number of 232, gathered on the bowling green for their annual parade. I gave them a short address. The heat was great, &amp; 3 lads were led away in a collapsing condition = but on the whole the service was pleasing.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I motored to Sunderland, &amp; preached at Evensong in S. Andrew's. Deptford. The old Vicar, Cheeseman, was ordained in 1874, so that he cannot be less than 77 years old, &amp; he is not well reported of for zeal &amp; activity. But he has a good voice, &amp; the service was more edifying than I had expected.</hi>
