         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 24 communicants. The congregation at 11 a.m. was greater, &amp; that at 7 p.m. was less than usual. Only 17 men attended my Bible Class. <persName xml:id="26">Bob Bayliss</persName> lunched with me, &amp; I admitted him to be a <orgName xml:id="2">Chancellor</orgName>. <persName xml:id="27" display="no">Harry Walgrave</persName> came to tea &amp; stayed to Church service.

         <p>Dear M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Henson,</p>
         <p>Her Majesty allows me to ask you whether you will accept the Canonry at Westminster Abbey, which is vacant by the transference of <persName xml:id="44">Canon Robinson</persName> to the Stall which was occupied by <persName xml:id="45">Canon Furse</persName>. I should be very glad if you saw your way to the acceptance of this appointment as it will give you a wider and more influential audience as a preacher.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours very Truly</p>

         <p>I have the honour to acknowledge your Lordship's letter of October 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> conveying Her Majesty's gracious proposal that I should accept the vacant Canonry at Westminster Abbey. After careful consideration I conceive it to be my duty to do so, &amp; in announcing that decision to your Lordship I desire to add my sincere thanks for you Lordship's kindness.</p>
