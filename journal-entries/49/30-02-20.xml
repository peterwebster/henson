         <p>I wasted most part of the morning in trying to make a start on the Article which I promised <hi rend="doubleunderline">Harris</hi>, but I was not feeling well, &amp; made little progress.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Wallis</hi> came to lunch, and afterwards discufsed with me the pros and cons of the proposal that he should accept appointment to the church in the Bailey which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Guillaume</hi> has vacated.  After he had departed, I walked round the Park.  The brilliant sunshine and the absence of wind made everything beautiful.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I motored to West Hartlepool where I instituted the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Revd. H.A. Thompson</hi> to the perpetual curacy of St. Aidan's in succefsion to the late Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Knowlden</hi>. There was a large congregation, and a good muster of the clergy. We returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Poole</hi><hi rend="italic"> showed a type written letter which is being sent to the parochial clergy by the Industrial Christian Fellowship.  It sends them commendations from the two Primates, bids them observe Low Sunday as 'Industrial Sunday', urges them to use appropriate prayers in the services, and offers to supply the same.  </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">And all this without the slightest reference to the Bishop of the diocese, who might as well not exist.</hi>
