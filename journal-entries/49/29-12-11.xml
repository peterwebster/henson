<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> &amp; I motored to Durham for the School Confirmation.  There were 48 boys confirmed, including 3 from the Cathedral Choir.  It was (to me) a pleasing service.  Afterwards <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek Elliott</hi> came to me in the Cloisters, &amp; we provisionally arranged that he should stay at Auckland from Monday 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to Friday 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> January.  He is growing tall, &amp; looks pale.  His operation may explain his appearance of delicacy.  Then I had some talk with my Suffragan on parochial business.  We returned to the Castle for lunch.  Afterwards, I walked round the Park in wind and rain with the dogs.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Dingle</hi>, the Rector of Egglescliffe, writes to me respecting my address at the Stockton meeting. He urges the familiar and always effective plea that, however desirable freedom might be for the Church, yet the State would suffer by its concession, and that, therefore, the duty of Churchmen was surrender of liberty for the nation's sake. I wrote to him a civil and sufficient reply. The fear of Disendowment is certainly the governing consideration in the minds of all these good people.</p>
