         <p>After the violent tempests of last week the calm night was most welcome. As one grows older wind and storm become ever more unpleasing. There are no '<hi rend="underline">gaudia certaminis'</hi> [rejoicings of struggle] for the aging and the aged.  Not the future with its possible triumphs, but the past with its accumulating failures dominates the mind of an old man.  Veterans are ever cautious because they have so little to gain, and what they yet possess is so easily lost.</p>
         <p>I went to S. Anne's &amp; celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 o'clock.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Randle Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</hi> promising him to officiate at his wedding at S. Martin's&#8211;in&#8211;the&#8211;Fields on Feb. 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, if he will fix the function at 2.30 p.m.</p>
         <p>Also, I wrote to General Lenox Scott, thanking him for the gift of his Autobiography '<hi rend="underline">Some Memories of a Soldier</hi>'.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi> &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mary Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</hi> accompanied me to Sunderland, where I preached at Evensong in the Church of the Venerable Bede.  The night was wet, &amp; the congregation disappointing.</p>
