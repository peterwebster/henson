         <p>A brilliant morning illumining a snow–clothed landscape. Temperature relatively mild.</p>
         <p>I motored into Durham, &amp; had a conference with the Archdeacons in my room at 11 a.m. Then I licensed a number of assistant curates, including Heaver to Houghton–le–Spring, Linnell<persName xml:id="5468"></persName> to Whitburn, &amp; Wilson to S. Margaret's, Durham. I returned to Auckland for lunch.</p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to South Shields, where I confirmed 167 persons in S Mary's, Tynedock. There was a large congregation. The proportion of males to females was normal – 65 to 102. This church is definitely Anglo–Cath:, but there is a genuine devotion, and no extravagance. I could wish that as much could be said about the 'moderate' and 'Evangelical' churches.</p>
         <p>The evening paper reports that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Balfour</hi> died this morning.  He is the last of the giants.  My personal contacts with him were always most agreeable: and I think he had a liking for me.</p>
