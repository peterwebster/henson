         <p>Be not the first by whom the new are tried,<lb/>Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.</p>
         <p>Pope. 'Essay on Criticism.'</p>
         <p>There is a half cynical wisdom in these lines which my observation of my contemporaries recognizes as underlying much of the policy of our leaders.</p>
         <p>A young man named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Eddon</hi>, the son of the Vicar of Craghead, and employed as a school&#8211;teacher in Tynedock, came to see me. He desires to be accepted as a candidate for Holy Orders, but he knows neither Latin nor Greek, and looks a very dull specimen indeed. I asked him what he had read, &amp; he replied, "<hi rend="underline">Rudyard Kipling</hi>"! And really, I think he has read nothing beyond a little fiction.</p>
         <p>I motored to Newcastle, &amp; went for the week end to Benwell Tower to stay with the Bishop. But I felt very unwell: &amp; after dinner, of which I could eat little, I had to go to bed. I was very sick, &amp; passed a poor night. The prospect of preaching in the Cathedral tomorrow began to take an unwelcome aspect. It is annoying but unavoidable.</p>
