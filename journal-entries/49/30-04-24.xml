         <p>The weather was warm and damp. It cleared up after lunch, when the ladies went out via the car to pay calls, and M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Donald and I walked and talked for two hours.  We went through Barochan, which is now possessed by a man named Collins, who bought it from Lady Renshaw.  How well I remember my last visit to that house.  It was the end of July, and the bolt of war fell in the first days of August 1914.  Sir Charles Renshaw cashed a cheque for &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">25</hi> for me at his carpet works, &amp; Ella &amp; I hastened back to Durham.  The country is disfigured by the gaunt steel standards which carry the electric current for commercial purposes.  The announcement affixed to them stated that they transmitted 132,000 volts.  The 'power' is not yet available for use.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Donald is an interesting companion, for he knows the country well, and has an antiquarian's acquaintance with local &amp; family interest.  Moreover he has a considerable knowledge of literature, a retentive memory, &amp; a genuine sense of humour.  He entertained me well through the longest walk I have taken for many months.</p>
