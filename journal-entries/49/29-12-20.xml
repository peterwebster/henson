         <p>I despatched the MS. of my address to S.P.C.K. after making a few last corrections. There came to lunch a youth named Clifford Wilson from Norton. He has just completed his first term at Keble College, and seeks a Diocesan grant to supplement his county Council scholarship of &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">80</hi>. I approved his selection by the Grants Committee.</p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to Durham for the Ordination. Canon Gordon arrived in good time for his address at Evensong. He spoke from notes, and said some good things. I had interviews with all the 12 men – 6 deacons, 6 priests – who are to be ordained. I decided that the Gospeller should be M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Reginald Dru Drury.  To the candidates for Priest's Orders, I gave two books – Lightfoot's Ordination Addresses, and my own "Church and Parson in England".</p>
         <p>The weather has become bitterly cold. There is snow on the ground, and promise of more. The Castle is penetrated with searching draughts. At Compline the candidates were invested in their overcoats. Aubrey Pike played the organ in Chapel, &amp; Pattinson read the service.</p>
