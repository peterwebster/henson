         <p>A brilliant morning &amp; a sharp frost. The chapel in the sunlight was magnificent. It tears one's heart to think that it may be secularized and, perhaps, profaned: but 'the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands'.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8a.m. We were 7 communicants including John.</p>
         <p>I finished the sermon which I shall preach tonight, but I am so burdened with a cold that preaching must be difficult.</p>
         <p>Ella went with me to South Shields, where I preached at Evensong in Holy Trinity. In spite of the weather, which was villainous, there was a considerable congregation: and, though there were many bad coughs among my hearers, I cannot fairly complaint of inattention. The service was well read by Cecil Beroth, and the worship was congregational &amp; reverent. I noted with pleasure the good order of the choristers, and the number of Boys Scouts in the front seats. I allowed myself to think that the work in this parish was making good progress. We got back to the Castle at 10 minutes after 9 o'clock.</p>
