         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> reports the death of Chancellor <hi rend="doubleunderline">Aubrey T. Lawrence</hi>, at the age of 55.  He gave me a copy of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cripps</hi>' '<hi rend="underline">Law relating to Church and Clergy'</hi>: and had shown evidences of kindly feelings toward me, after a long spell of ignorant abhorrence!</p>

He is alleged to have cried "Damn the Bishops"! in the course of a sermon, &amp; his language is scarcely sane: &amp; yet, horribly offensive as it is, there is hardly anything actionable in it: &amp;, hitherto, I have had no complaint from the P.P.</hi>

Mary's, took me to the Infirmary, where I confirmed a sick youth in his bed. After the service in S. Mark's, we returned to Auckland.</p>
