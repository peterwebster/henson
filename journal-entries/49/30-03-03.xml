         <p>I received from D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Cooper a satisfactory report on Sykes's condition:</p>
         <p>"You will be pleased to hear that Sykes went to Church here this morning, and took Holy Communion, &amp; has since yesterday seemed very much more at ease. His action today pleases me immensely, as he has not felt able to do this for many many weeks. With kind regards &amp; many thanks for your splendid help &amp; cooperation."</p>
         <p>I wish I could feel confident that the benefit will be permanent.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park. The air was mild &amp; yet fresh. Everything was vocal.</p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to Annefield[sic] Plain, where I confirmed more than 70 candidates. Dick really seems to be make headway, and Betts at Collierley is certainly an enormous improvement on Fisher Ferguson.</p>
         <p>Dick spoke to me about a Methodist minister, 40 years of age, who desires to be ordained, and who, in his judgment is in every respect fully qualified for Ordination.</p>
