<hi rend="doubleunderline">Harry Dobson</hi> &amp; his wife came to lunch.  Afterwards he did his best to explain the curious complaint that I had received from one of his former parishioners.  The Rev. Mr. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Wynter</hi>, Secretary for S.P.C.K. also came to lunch – a large man who asked for my Blessing &amp; kissed my hand! </p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Geoffrey Faber</hi><persName xml:id="5792"></persName> sent me a book – '<hi rend="underline">Who moved the stone?</hi>' by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Frank Morrison</hi> – and requested an opinion on it.  I was sufficiently interested to read it through.  The author turns the tables on the advanced criticks by adopting their own method of bold &amp; arbitrary hypothesis, &amp; showing that the slender narratives of the Resurrection can be thereby made to sustain the affirmation of the Creed quite reasonably.  He writes clearly &amp; reverently.</p>
