<hi rend="italic">Davison, the Vicar of S</hi><hi rend="i superscript">t.</hi><hi rend="italic"> Helen's, Auckland, came to pour out his grievance against Hodgson, the Vicar of Escomb, who has made himself offensively active during the County Council election, &amp; apparently behaved in a very unbecoming manner.  He gave me the personal history of Hodgson, which was certainly of a disconcerting kind, &amp; makes both his Ordination and his appointment to a benefice extremely surprising.  I had to explain that I c</hi><hi rend="i superscript">d.</hi><hi rend="italic"> not possibly take notice of his political activities.  But the state of Escomb, which has now enjoyed his ministry for 12 years weighs on my conscience.</hi>

         <p>Christopher Birney came to lunch, &amp; walked round the Park with me. He has come back from Australia, &amp; desires to be ordained, but of course, his preparation is a serious, &amp;, perhaps, an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
         <p>General Hencomb, &amp; Lady Eden came to an early dinner, &amp; witnessed the entertainment organized by the Household. There was a large company, who appreciated the performance very heartily.</p>
