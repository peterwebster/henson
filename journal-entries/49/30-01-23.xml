         <p>The rev. G.W. Boddy, Vicar of S. Chad's, York, came to lunch, &amp; to talk about the possibility of his becoming beneficed in this parish. He impressed me well.</p>
         <p>Ella accompanied me to Sunderland, where we had an early dinner with M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Richardson, &amp; then went to the Bede Collegiate School, where the annual Prize distribution was to take place.  This was the first occasion on which this function had taken place in the new building.  There was a considerable gathering of parents and old girls, so that the great Hall was filled.  Alderman Nicholson, the one&#8211;armed man who was Mayor, presided, &amp; was 'supported' by a platform of municipal worthies.  I spoke for about half an hour, &amp; then gave the girls their prizes.  There were the usual flatterous speeches, &amp; then we sang "<hi rend="underline">God save the King</hi>" and came away. We got home about 10 p.m. Now is this an expenditure of time &amp; energy which can justify itself as coming fairly under the description of episcopal duty? Perhaps it does if we allow to it a certain value as widening the area of episcopal influence.</p>
