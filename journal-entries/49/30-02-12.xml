         <p>Pattinson and I motored to York, where I attended the meeting of Convocation. There was really no business worth transacting, and everything was over by lunch time. I moved a resolution about the persecution of Christians in Russia, and made a short &amp; foolish speech. After lunching with the Archbishop, we returned to Auckland. Then I disposed of the morning's correspondence.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Burge</hi> had written to me asking me to assist D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charnwood</hi> in his preparation of a Memoir of her husband, the late Bishop of Oxford, by letting him have any letters which were worth publishing.  I had to say that the Bishop's letters were always concerned with personal and immediate matters, &amp; mostly had not been preserved.  It is rather humiliating to have such a meagre collection of interesting letters, but, partly, I have played a 'lone&#8211;hand', and, partly, the practice of writing serious letters has passed away.  The habit of typing letters has destroyed their literary &amp; permanent interest.</p>
