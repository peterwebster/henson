         <p>I received the Holy Communion in the tiny chapel which does duty until something better has been built by the diocese. This house appears to be admirably placed. It is quiet, &amp; commands from the windows magnificent prospects. Without being pretentious &amp; expensively large, it is convenient &amp; sufficient. After breakfast the bishop and I 'talked large' until he had to go off to a service, and Mrs. Herbert brought her three charming children, 2 boys, George &amp; David, &amp; the youngest, a girl, to see me. Then I proceeded to revise my notes for the men's service.</p>
         <p>The men's service in the Cathedral was largely attended. I spoke on 'Freedom in the Church â€“ what it is, &amp; what it is not', &amp; said a number of very indiscreet things, most of which were true. Then I had tea with Canon Sinker<persName xml:id="5415"></persName>, &amp; remained at the Vicarage until Evensong, when I preached to a very large congregation in the Cathedral, repeating the sermon which I had preached at South Shields. Canon Sinker returned with me to the Bishop's House, and stayed to supper.</p>
