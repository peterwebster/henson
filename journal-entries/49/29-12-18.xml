<hi rend="italic">I spent the morning in writing a charge for the Ordination Candidates â€“ a very difficult undertaking at all times, and never so difficult as at this time. The main difficulty arises from the knowledge which the Bishop cannot but possess, that the spiritual direction of those whom he ordains does not lie with him, but with others, probably the authorities of some seminary, whom he may not know, whom he cannot control, and whose doctrine &amp; practice he may wholly disapprove. The candidates endure his counsels, but it never occurs to them to heed them. Like the books of the Alexandrian library in the legend of the Moslem who burned them, a Bishop's advice is superfluous for, if it be "Catholick" it will already have been given by somebody else, and if it be "Protestant" it is plainly mischievous. Protestants &amp; Modernists have no "spiritual use" for Bishops, and Anglo&#8211;Catholicks have use only for "Catholick" Bishops. If one have the misfortune to lie outside the description 'Catholick', no deference is paid to one's advice, and scant respect shown to one's office and person. They kiss your ring, and &#8211; disobey you!</hi>
