         <p>There was a large congregation at matins, but not so large as I had expected.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ralph </hi>was preaching in the Temple, &amp; probably drew away such people after him. However, Lord Scarbrough &amp; his wife, Lord Davidson, Miss Haldane, &amp; Lady Struthers were there. My sermon took exactly (there was a clock in the pulpit) 35 minutes in delivery, and it was very closely listened to.</p>
         <p>We lunched with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Haldane</hi> in her quaint little house opposite the Papist Cathedral.  There was a Miss Blackett also there.</p>
         <p>We attended Evensong in the Abbey, &amp; heard Storr preach. He has a good manner, an engaging appearance, and a pleasant voice. The sermon was more Evangelical in the old&#8211;fashioned way than I had expected. There was not a large congregation.</p>
         <p>We had tea in the Deanery, and then made some calls.  I saw <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> in bed with sciatica, but as cheerfully ego&#8211;centric as usual, and then had some talk with the Headmaster, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Costley&#8211;White</hi>. Noel came in to supper from his Hospital, &amp; so we went to bed.</p>
