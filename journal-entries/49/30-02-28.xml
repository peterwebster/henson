         <p>I motored to Middleton S. George, and had an interview with Sykes in his 'nursing home'. It was rather painful, and I doubt whether it did not injure rather than assist the poor man. How pitiable is the disintegration of personality! On my return I wrote to M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Sykes, &amp; told her what I had done.</p>

         <p>A dense fog came on as evening approached. It was fortunate that we had no more distant engagement than a Prize distribution at Spennymoor. The Town Hall was filled with the boys and girls of the Secondary School, whose parents crowded the gallery &amp; back part of the Hall. I was amused by the obvious nervousness of the Chairman &amp; other members of the Education Committee, all hot Labourites. They obviously expected me to jump on their educational corns, &amp; were suitably relieved when I delivered myself in a series of the mildest platitudes! We crawled back to the Castle in a fog that seemed to grow ever denser.</p>
