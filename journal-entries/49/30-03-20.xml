         <p>A bright morning was followed by a cold and tempestuous day, which grew calm towards its close. Burkitt came to see me. He has been elected Chairman of the Governors of Barnard Castle School in my place. It is thought desirable in the interest of the school that the Bishop of Durham's connexion with it should be maintained, &amp;, therefore, he wished to know whether I w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> consent to be Visitor.  I said that, if elected, I would not refuse.</p>
         <p>During the afternoon I walked round the Park, where everything was sodden with rain, &amp; the streams full. Pattinson and I motored to Gateshead, where, first, I confirmed a sick girl privately in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> James's parish, and, next, went to Christ Church, and there confirmed 148 persons from the parishes of Christ Church, S. Cuthbert's, S. Chad's, and S. Andrew's.  The church, which is the largest in Gateshead, was crowded, &amp; everybody was very attentive.  After the service, we returned to Auckland, arriving at 9.45 p.m.</p>
         <p>I spent much time on the Spital sermon, but to little purpose. My right hand has 'lost its cunning'. These "side&#8211;shows" of special sermons devour one's life!</p>
