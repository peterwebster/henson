         <p>An Ordination candidate, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cecil Eskholme Charlton</hi>, came to lunch, and had some talk with me. He is but 20 1/2 years old, but his record is good, &amp; he impressed me favourably. I am rather sorry that he is at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>Chad's.  After he had departed, I walked round the Park with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi>.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Baldwin's speech as Rector to the students of Glasgow University is very prominently reported in the </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">. He spoke on "Character', and expressed himself very felicitously. He was less optimistic than his wont.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">"The world is contracting &amp; scientific invention, by flying, by wireless, by the motorâ€“car, by films, &amp; the gramophone, is jostling the peoples of the world together, &amp; he would be a bold prophet, who would tell us whether these things will make for the elevation of mankind or for its degradation."</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I fear that my own mind inclines ever more decidedly to embrace the more sinister judgement. The total effect of the new conditions is not favourable to the moral &amp; mental health of the people.</hi>
