<hi rend="italic bold underline">I made preparation for a sermon on the Russian Persecution by collecting the relevant facts so far as they are conveyed by the books that I possess.</hi><hi rend="italic">  But the whole story of Russian Christianity is squalid and confused.  It is impossible to deny that the Church in Russia had been the obsequious tool of the Czardom, and the consistent enemy of every form of freedom.  I read the chapters on Russia in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Cambridge Modern History</hi><hi rend="italic"> in order to rectify my general perspective, and then tried to piece together a coherent view of the present situation.

Nor may we forget that the Persecutors have in the recent history of their Victims much that gives plausibility to their hypocritical pretence that they are not persecuting the Religion but rather suppressing Rebels.</hi>
