         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 11 communicants, including Pattinson, William &amp; his wife, and (for the last time) John. He goes off to his new situation this week, having now outgrown my service.</p>
         <p>I wrote a long letter to Jack Clayton, and copied it into my letter&#8211;book.</p>
         <p>Also, I wrote to my late Butler's boy, James Leslie Wilson, who is now a footman in the service of the Hon. W.W. Vivian in Bangor.</p>
         <p>Ella and Fearne accompanied me as far as Durham, where they attended the music in the Cathedral â€“ Mendelssohn's S. Paul. I went on to Sunderland, where I preached at Evensong in S. Gabriel's. There was a large, and attentive congregation. I heard the last part of the music, recovered the ladies when the performance was over, and so returned to Auckland. The evening was very wet, &amp; no doubt the fact had an ill effect on the congregation in the Cathedral. This appeared to be in great part composed of students of both sexes, and shop assistants. I did not see a single (recognizable) artisan.</p>
