         <p>The papers are filled with reports of the damage done by the great storm. At High Wycombe a man and his wife were killed in bed when the roof of their house was blown off. This recalls the similar tragedy in the great storm of Nov: 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 1703, when Bishop <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kidder</hi> and his wife were both killed in their bed by the falling of a stack of chimneys.  The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> emphasizes the connexion between the recent heavy rainfall, and the unusual destruction of trees.  The saturation of the soil had 'loosened to some extent the hold of even the largest trees'.  'The frequent alternations from lull to squall gave the wind additional destructive power.'</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi> before lunch, &amp; had much talk with him.  He is modest and intelligent.</p>
         <p>The Rainbows came to lunch, and then came the Wilsons â€“ a regular children's party; and, when they had gone, we all motored to Gateshead, and attended Stephenson's annual Ruri&#8211;decanal party. It was crowded, noisy, good&#8211;tempered, and evidently pleased with itself! We got back to Auckland shortly after 10 p.m.</p>
