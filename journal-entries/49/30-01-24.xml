         <p>Ella and I motored into Durham, and lunched with Captain <hi rend="doubleunderline">Morley,</hi> the chief constable, and his wife.  Colonel <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ruthven</hi> and his wife were there.  It was a pleasant party.  We returned to Auckland, where I resumed work on the Westminster Sermon.
