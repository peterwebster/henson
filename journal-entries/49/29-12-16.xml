         </p>
         <p>A most beautiful morning with just enough frost to give firmness to the ground and keenness to the air. I received the draft of a letter to the Times on Durham Castle, which, of course, I had to re&#8211;write!</p>
         <p>Then I went to the Bank, and ascertained that the cheques sent to Kenneth had been cashed. I wrote to M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Hodgson about him.  Prof. Heawood lunched here, and we agreed on the final draft of the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> letter.</p>
         <p>Then Pattinson &amp; I walked round the Park, which was delightful. The glow of the sunset, seen through the leafless trees, &amp; reflected in the still though hasting water of the Guanless, was unforgettable.</p>
         <p>An ordination candidate from Rochdale, named Ronald Selkirk Woodall, aged 20 years &amp; 7 months, arrived to stay the night, &amp; be inspected. After dinner I had a 'heart&#8211;to&#8211;heart' talk with him, and decided to accept him provisionally i.e. if nothing untoward happened, &amp; he took his degree. Ella, Fearne, and Miss Headlam went to the School Concert in Durham, &amp; did not return until nearly 11 p.m.</p>
