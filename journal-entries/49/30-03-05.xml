<hi rend="bold">Ash Wednesday, March 5</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Very mild and still weather: later rain.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 8 comm</hi><hi rend="i sup u">ts</hi><hi rend="italic"> Including John.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I received a long carefully&#8211;typed letter from one </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Panton</hi><hi rend="italic">, whose name is wholly unknown to me.  It began by a reference to my letter in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic"> in support of Earl Grey's 'Sponsor Scheme', </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">assured me that the shortage of clergy in the diocese of Durham ws entirely owing to the repulsive personality of the present Bishop, &amp; went on to review my career in terms of elaborate insult. It interested me by its venom, &amp; evident knowledge of the diocese.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">I finished the Article, &amp; sent it to the new Editor of the 'XIX</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Century &amp; After'.</hi>  It was very short, confused, &amp;, for my purpose in writing it, wholly inadequate.  But it must serve.</p>
         <p>Then I walked in the Park for an hour in spite of the rain.</p>
         <p>The Chaplain from Barnard Castle lunched here.  He desired to interest me in a boy, aged 18, named Race, who thinks that he has a vocation to the Ministry, but, of course, needs financial assistance. </p>
