         </p>
         <p>I vow to thee, my country â€“ all earthly things above &#8211;<lb/>Entire &amp; whole &amp; perfect, the service of my love,<lb/>The love that asks no questions: the love that stands the test,<lb/>That lays upon the altar the dearest &amp; the best:<lb/>The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,<lb/>The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.<lb/>And there's another country, I've heard of long ago &#8211; <lb/>Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know &#8211; <lb/>We may not count her armies: we may not see her King &#8211; <lb/>Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering &#8211; <lb/>And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,<lb/>And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.</p>

         <p>A wet, stormy day, with every promise of bad weather. The cycle&#8211;racing competition in the Park on Monday has an ill look.</p>
         <p>I wrote a short sermon for the Scout's Service in the Cathedral.</p>
         <p>In spite of the wind &amp; rain I walked to Bryden's Cottage, but got so wet I had to bath &amp; change.</p>
         <p>I finished reading a short book of sketches by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Stephen Gwynn</hi>, "<hi rend="underline">Saints and Scholars</hi>", which was given me by Canon McCullagh.  The description of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mark Pattison</hi> interested me particularly.  He died in the very year, 1884, in which I was elected at All Souls, &amp; I remember hearing much gossip about him &amp; his wife.  He had never been to a public school, &amp; he never seems to have regretted the fact.  He was a cynical, self&#8211;centred man.  Here is a judgement of his which provokes thought, &amp;, perhaps, contradiction:&#8211;</p>
         <p>"<hi rend="bold underline">It seems to me one of the marks of greatness that the great man is never represented by his books</hi>.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Voltaire</hi> is a signal instance: what heaps of trash the 75 vols. of his works consist of, nor has he left a single production which taken separately can be said to be worth reading . . . . Yet Voltaire is the greatest figure in the whole of the 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century." </p>
