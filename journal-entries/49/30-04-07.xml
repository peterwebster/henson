         <p>The King spoke last night with almost bitter repugnance about his having to receive the Russian Ambassador – "<hi rend="underline">The man looks like a little dirty Jewish clerk</hi>". His "wife" has three husbands living, &amp; what her real relation to her "husband" actually is appears to be very doubtful. But he is enamoured with her, &amp; she serves as an agent of the Cheka, to watch him. "<hi rend="underline">If I give a Garden Party, all the ambassadors &amp; their wives must come to my tent: and the Queen will have to receive her</hi>". His Majesty's disgust was eloquent.</p>
         <p>I breakfasted with the Household, and then left the Castle. In town I visited the hair–dresser and the book–seller, &amp; then took the 1.15 p.m. express from King's Cross to Darlington. My carriage was shared by a large conversational man, who, he informed me, was on his way to Newcastle in order to inspect the industrial schools. I gave him a copy of my pamphlet on "Church &amp; State in England". I think he said that his name was Scooly. It was something that sounded like that!</p>
