<hi rend="doubleunderline">Francis Leslie Race</hi> of 12 Croft Avenue, Crook, came to see me.  He was sent by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sargent, the Chaplain of Barnard Castle School.   He wants to become a clergyman, but, as he is but 18 years old, his desire must not be over&#8211;valued.  He seemed a decent, well&#8211;mannered youth, but nowise impressive.  I told him to write to Maish.</p>

<hi rend="italic">I walked in the Park. Four of the caddies informed me that they were going to be confirmed, &amp; had just started the class at Coundon. All of them have left school, none of them have any work. They are moving into manhood without an employment &amp; without discipline. What is before them but rapid degeneration of character, &amp; loss of civic value? And they are but representative of many thousands of English boys. It is a degrading and heart&#8211;piercing spectacle. And the Bishop must see the whole tragedy proceeding under his eyes, and do nothing!</hi>
