         <p>The new vicar of St. John's, Darlington came to lunch.  His name is <hi rend="doubleunderline">Stephens</hi>, and his main spiritual experience has been in the air force! He is a large man, tall and well proportioned, with a rather heavy countenance, which could easily become sullen.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I walked in the Park after lunch, &amp; came upon a company of at least 15 magpies. There was so mighty a chattering in a tree that I clapped my hands, whereat the noisy fowl emerged, &amp; I counted them as they flew.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi>, and I motored to Durham, where I instituted the new vicar, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pickering</hi> to St. Nicholas.  There was a considerable gathering of the clergy from the rural deanery, including 3 of the canons from the cathedral, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lillingston</hi>, as Rural Dean, inducted him. The congregation filled the church, and in it was the Mayor of Durham. I had taken pains to prepare notes for my address on the text â€“ "<hi rend="underline">Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. And God hath set some in His Church</hi>". I spoke about the church, and particularly about the Church of England. We returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
