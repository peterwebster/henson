<hi rend="italic">I wrote a short article on "Would Disestablishment be good or bad?" for a paper called 'This &amp; That' of which I had never heard before. But the Editor undertook to send ten guineas to the Durham Castle (Preservation) Fund, and it seemed worth while to write 1500 words for that!</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Leng</hi> managed to get hold of a small car, and drove <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and me to Preston&#8211;on&#8211;Tees where I admitted the Rev. Angus Macdonald to the cure of that district.  He is rather a rough specimen, and not very encouraging in manner, but 14 years at Chopwell might take the charm out of anybody!  There was a fair congregation.  I had prepared no address, and spoke 'of the surface of my mind', and, I fear, spoke badly.  These institutions are so frequent that it becomes extremely difficult not to repeat one's self, and there are some things which must be said.</p>
         <p>Mr. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Voelcker</hi>, the Executive Director &amp; Secretary of the Synthetic Ammonia &amp; Nitrate Ltd., wrote very civilly to invite me to pay another visit to the Works, but I had to reply that I could not do so until after Easter.</p>
