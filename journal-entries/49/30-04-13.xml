         <p>Summer time begins today.  The clocks were put forward an hour last night.  The morning is brilliant and wonderfully warm: &amp; the birds rhapsodically eucharistic. </p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered but 7 communicants.</p>

         <p>I went to South Church, and confirmed 117 persons from the parishes of Bishop Auckland, Shildon, and Coundon. The combined population is about 32,000. There ought to have been at least 500 candidates!</p>
         <p>I motored to Shotton, and preached at Evensong.  The church, which is a small one for 9000 people, was crowded: the service was reverent &amp; congregational, and the attention was close.  I was particularly glad to see a good number of young men in the congregation.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gerald Rainbow</hi>, who is now 15, was at home for his holiday. He is taller than his Father. I noticed also that the Vicarage garden was well kept, and I took a favourable impression. After the service I returned to Auckland by way of Wingate. This is certainly the shorter route.</p>
