<hi rend="doubleunderline">Silva&#8211;White</hi>, the Vicar of St. Peter's, Bishopwearmouth came to see me, and stayed to lunch.  He told his story of difficulties with his care&#8211;taker, and affected to seek my directions on matters respecting which a cat of average intelligence could hardly err!  However, I was complaisant, attentive, &amp; didactic!  </p>
         <p>Then I walked with the old doctor in the Park for an hour. </p>

<hi rend="italic">Pattinson and I motored to Eppleton, a woe be gone mining village with a parish church of the squalidest type.  There I licenced the Rev. Gibson Salisbury to the perpetual curacy of the parish.  There was a large congregation, &amp; a good muster of the clergy.  The new incumbent is a poor creature to look at, &amp; has some kind of an impediment in his speech, but he is said to have worked well &amp; acceptably as an assistant (afsistant) curate in Chester&#8211;Le&#8211;Street.  In these ill times we may be thankful to get anybody as good!  I have no doubts in my mind that the weakest point in our ecclesiastical system is the personnel of the clergy.  They are physically, mentally, and (in general sense) morally inferior, not bad but below the level of professional quality.    </hi>
