<hi rend="italic bold underline">publishes my letter, which reads a less savagely than I had feared. Indeed it is even mild! A little paragraph announces the publication of my pamphlet on "Church &amp; State", and states that "The Bishop will speak on the subject at the Church Assembly next week, when he will draw attention to this pamphlet". This announcement is equally improper, unfortunate, and altogether unwarranted.</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">The Editor of the 'Church of England' newspaper sent me a telegram</hi><hi rend="i bold">:</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Can you kindly write by next Tuesday Article of about one thousand words on Church &amp; State for front page Church of England newspaper.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I was foolish enough to telegraph the word "Yes". What is it I really want to say? Perhaps it would suffice to ask the question, Why is the present situation intolerable? and to show in the process of answering that there is no alternative to 'Disestablishment'. The bother is that the reluctance to disestablish is on the side of the State!</hi>
