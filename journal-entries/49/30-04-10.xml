<hi rend="bold">Thursday, April 10</hi><hi rend="bold superscript doubleunderline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">I received an affectionate letter from </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Derek</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> telling me that his mother approved of his purpose in the matter of Holy Orders.  I wrote at once to say how pleased I was, and that the question of his academic education after leaving school must be considered with the Headmaster.  The plot thickens.  My experience with </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> was not encouraging: but </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Derek</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> seems to be of a finer texture, and it is always permissible to think well of the young.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I motored into Durham, &amp; presided over meetings of the Boards of Training &amp; Maintenance, &amp; of the Conference. We decided to hold the Diocesan Conference on Saturday, the 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> of June, and to discuss the League of Nations.  I had tea with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Knights</hi>, &amp; then returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>I motored to Sunderland, where I confirmed 101 persons in All Saints, Monkwearmouth. They came from that parish, &amp; from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Andrew's, Roker.  The church was crowded: the candidates were fairly distributed between the sexes: &amp; I was pleased with their appearance and behaviour.</p>
         <p>The weather today has been quite warm, &amp; so continues.</p>
