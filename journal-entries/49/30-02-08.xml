         <p>I wrote to Canon Sinker<persName xml:id="5415"></persName> proposing to take for the subject of my address to his Men's meeting on the 23<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> of February, the following: â€“ "<hi rend="underline">Freedom in the Church: what it is, and what it is not</hi>".</p>
         <p>I lunched in Park Lane, and afterwards went with Lord Scarbrough to see the Film (talkie) "Disraeli".  It was, of course grossly unhistorical, but it was amusing, &amp; carried one along.  Lord S. thought it would be useful as 'propaganda' for the Empire. </p>
         <p>I proceeded to Dean's Yard, &amp; joined Ella.  There came to dinner Noel, a nurse from S. Thomas's, Miss Taynton, and Lord Tomline &amp; his wife.  He told me that he was my 'counsel', when I was 'confirmed' at Bow Church in January 1918.  <hi rend="bold underline">Vernon Storr is full of correspondence, &amp; of the kind of importance which goes with the organization of a 'movement'. He is a good fellow, but not equal to the task of effecting an operative fellowship between Evangelists and Modernists. It could but be a Magentian union at best, &amp; I doubt if it can be even as much as that.</hi>
