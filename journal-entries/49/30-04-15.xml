         <p>The Budget justifies the melancholy forebodings with which it had been anticipated. Sixpence more on the income tax, and a formidably revised sur&#8211;tax will add to my expenditure, as I judge, something like &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">500</hi> per annum.  This is really embarrassing.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">I received a demand for &#x00A3;</hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">132</hi><hi rend="bold underline">, for newspapers supplied for the nine years of my residence in Auckland Castle.  No account had been sent to me through all that time, &amp; I had assumed that the money had been paid by </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Alexander</hi><hi rend="bold underline">. I sent a cheque, after having the salesman into my room, &amp; rating him.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Two aspirants to Ordination – <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dobbs</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Burton</hi> – lunched here, &amp; were interviewed.  Neither has a degree.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I motored to Newbottle, where I confirmed 69 persons from that parish &amp; from Herrington.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">L</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Charnwood</hi> at some length in answer to an inquiry which he had made with reference to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Burge</hi>'s behaviour at the time of my Consecration on February 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> 1918.</p>
