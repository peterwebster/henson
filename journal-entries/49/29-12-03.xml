         <p>My painter and his wife were taken by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi> to Durham, and shown the Buildings, to which they brought a keen &amp; intelligent appreciation.  They returned for lunch, &amp; then returned to London.  I spent the morning in writing letters.  Among others I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon Raven</hi> and the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Oxford</hi>. In the afternoon I walked round the Park with the dogs.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson </hi>&amp; I motored to Hartlepool, where I addressed the Parochial Church Councillors in the Town Hall.  About 220 attended, the new Rural Dean, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon Poole</hi>, presided. The audience was neither responsive nor hostile, but attentive, depressed, and perhaps somewhat perplexed. The general impression I received was that they resented so large an issue as Disestablishment having emerged from so unpalatable an occasion as the rejection of the Revised Prayer Book, which nobody wanted, &amp; mainly actively disliked. They could not but admit that the issue had emerged, but they disliked &amp; regretted having to face it. There were few questions, not enough to quicken the proceedings!</p>
