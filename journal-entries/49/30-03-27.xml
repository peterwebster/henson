         <p>The mild weather continues. I continued to work on the 'Bishoprick' article: but not with much affect. I have not yet really "struck oil". Pattinson and I walked round the Park. The old doctor, who is out again, although rather shaky on his legs, went with us part of the way. We motored to Houghton–le–Spring, where I confirmed more than 150 persons in the parish church. They came from the parish, and the two next parishes, West Rainton and Burnmoor. There was a large congregation. The candidates were attentive &amp; reverent. On the whole I was pleased with the service.</p>

<hi rend="bold underline">My Brother of Newcastle resents some recent gabblings of the Dean of Durham, which he understands as a criticism of himself &amp; me</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>  The Dean had suggested that the reason why the clergy would not come to the north was the constant absenteeism of the Bishops, arising from the numerous meetings in London which they have to attend.  Personally I should have thought that such absenteeism, if it were a fact, would operate rather as an attraction than a deterrent.</p>
