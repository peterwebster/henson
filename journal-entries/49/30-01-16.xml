         <p>I shirked attendance at the Bishops' Meeting considering the agenda to be unimportant. After looking in on Hugh Rees L<hi rend="superscript underline">td</hi>, &amp; buying some books, I went to the S. P. C. K. depot in Northumberland Avenue, &amp; had an interview with the Editorial Secretary, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Lowther Clarke.  He is a son of that rather ponderous prelate, the late Archbishop of Melbourne, whose portrait adored the rather bleak walls of the office.  He spoke with some animation against the publishing activities of the Church Assembly, and evidently had no love for <hi rend="doubleunderline">Partridge</hi>, whom he regards as the autocrat of Church House!  After lunching in the Club, and having a rather interesting conversation with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Graves</hi> about his nephew's autobiography, which he regards with abhorrence, I motored <hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>travelled<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> to Darlington, and was met by Pattinson and Derek.  There was a thick fog, and a very slippery road, so that we took more than an hour in reaching the Castle.</p>
         <p>High Force, though magnificent, was so far disappointing, that the central rock was not covered by the Tees.</p>
