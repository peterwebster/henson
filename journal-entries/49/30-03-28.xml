         <p>Another mild day, but windy. I worked again on the 'Bishoprick' article, which does not become more coherent, as it grows longer! Ella and I attended the Speech Day of the local Grammar School, &amp; "sate under" our member, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hugh Dalton,<persName xml:id="5480"></persName> Under–Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  He is a large, loose–limbed man, with a tendency to baldness and an amiable smile, recognizably the son of his father, old Canon Dalton of Windsor.<persName xml:id="2383"></persName>  Pattinson and I motored to Washington where I confirmed more than 100 candidates from three parishes – Washington, Birtley, and Fatfield.  Old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Reeman. The Vicar of Fatfield, came with his candidates.  He was ordained as long ago as 1867.  He cannot be less than 87 years old.  He has been in his present parish for 54 years.  Of course he is quite past his work, which is done, so far as it is done at all, by a godly schoolmaster and the neighbouring clergy.  It would be both harsh and futile to coerce him into resignation: and it would certainly be very unpopular, for the old man has worked well in his day, &amp; his people are attached to him.
