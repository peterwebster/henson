         <p> A mild and beautiful day, very delightful. Archdeacon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Mangin left after breakfast.  I received several perturbing letters, among them one making enquiry about 4 of my clergy who are begging Lord Strathmore to appoint them to the "fat" living of Romaldkirk, in the diocese of Ripon.  To my surprize and distress, Froggatt and Spencer Wade were included in the quartett [sic].  Both plead the health of their sons as a reason for their action.  But what efficiency of service can be hoped for from men who are secretly trying to desert their charge?</p>
         <p>After lunch I picked up a youth just back from Cambridge for the vacation, &amp; walked round the Park with him.  I made him give me his name â€“ John Lindley Wilkinson, 13 Oak Avenue, Bishop Auckland.  He is but 19 years old.  </p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to Sunderland, where I confirmed more than 100 persons in S. Andrew's Deptford. The old Vicar, Cheeseman, is clearly past his work. He was ordained in 1874: so that he cannot possibly be far short of 80 years old &amp; may be more.</p>
