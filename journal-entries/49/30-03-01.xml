<hi rend="bold underline">Diocesan Conference</hi>

         <p>The fog continues, everything is swathed in a grey pall. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I motored to Durham, where I presided over the 'business' meeting of the Diocesan Conference in the Chapter House.  There was but a moderate attendance.  <hi rend="bold underline">My Presidential Address was brief, and concerned only with the situation in Russia. I directed the incumbents to observe Sunday, the 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> of March, as a day of prayer for the persecuted Russian church</hi>.  The business was quietly and rapidly got through.  I entertained at lunch in the Castle the following – Ferguson, Dickinson, Drury, Simpkinson, Mackay, and Hutton.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Arthur Harrison</hi> introduced the Budget very clearly, and, rather to my surprise, there was no objection to the raising of the quotas.  On the whole, it was rather a lifeless Conference, the unanimity expressing rather a lack of interest and general listlessness than a hearty unitedness of feeling.  After the Conference had dispersed, I went to tea with the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; discussed diocesan business with him.  I got back to the Castle at Auckland about 5.30 p.m.  The fog had cleared, but therer were signs of its returning.</p>

         <p>We had a dinner party viz. Sir Christopher &amp; Lady Furness (née Roberts), Colonel &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Finch, Archdeacon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Rawlinson, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Simpkinson, &amp; ourselves.  M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Finch is a Dutch woman.  She said that during the war there was great hardship in Holland for the shortage of food stuffs.  This surprised me.  Sir Christopher Furness is a stocky little man, very slightly weighted with ideas, and not much interested in affairs.  His wife pleased me on account of her evident interest in the country.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">A suggestive incident is reported in the newspapers.  The Archbishops have ordered prayers for Russian Christians.  The Government (i.e. the Army Council) have ordered Army chaplains not to do so!  The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Manchester Guardian'</hi><hi rend="italic">s comments are illuminating:</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">'One assumes that the Church of England, whose head is the King, must obey the orders of the King through the Government. It is quite another affair with Roman Catholic &amp; Nonconformist chaplains, who, in the one case, take their orders from the Pope, &amp; in the other case take their orders from nobody. From the C. of E. point there is no real difficulty. It is a national church'.</hi>
