         <p>I spent most of the morning in reading the volume "<hi rend="underline">The Rise of the Christian Church</hi>" which has just been published by the Cambridge Press. It is written by Binns, Hunkiss, &amp; Bethune&#8211;Baker, who severally treat of 1) The Jewish People &amp; their Faith. 2) The Earliest Christian Church. 3) Early Traditions about Jesus.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Modern Churchman</hi><hi rend="italic"> prints my letter, and also a rejoinder by </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bezzant</hi><hi rend="italic">, which is more offensive than before, but which must none the less remain unanswered.</hi>

         <p>I walked round the Park with my Chaplain. The little man is evidently thinking, but whether for good I am not sure. I fear that the Bishop is not very wholesome company for young parsons!</p>
         <p>A poor&#8211;looking man named Walton came to see me.  He aspires to be ordained; has had no other education than that of an elementary school: is 30 years old, and has saved &#x00A3;200 with a view to preparing for the ministry.  He is strongly commended on the ground of character &amp; piety.  I decided to send him to Rawlinson, with a request that <hi rend="underline">he</hi> would advise me.</p>
