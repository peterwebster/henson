         <p>Another delightful day, and very warm.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I finished the Edinburgh Sermon: &amp; then read through Headlam's article in the new issue of the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Church Quarterly</hi><hi rend="italic"> on 'The Christian Ministry'.  It is almost a personal apology for his change of front on Apostolic Succession.  He now stands where I stood when I wrote the volume '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Apostolic Christianity</hi><hi rend="italic">' in 1898. But I cannot base on his historical argument that insistence on the Episcopate as necessarily the form of government in an united Church. This seems to me to imply a theory of Apostolic Succession which is precisely that which he has confessedly abandoned.</hi>

         <p>The lay&#8211;reader from Jarrow Grange, Barnett, came to see me about Orders. I promised to allow him to sit for the deacon's Ordination next month.</p>
