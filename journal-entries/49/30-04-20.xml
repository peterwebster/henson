         <p>After the rain and storm the sun shone, but heavy clouds in the sky prohibited optimism.  The Chapel, which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Alexander</hi> had decorated for the Festival, looked very beautiful in the morning light.  We numbered 22 communicants.</p>
         <p>I motored to <hi rend="underline">Sedgefield</hi>, where I preached and celebrated in the parish church. There was a woefully small congregation, the bulk of whom, mostly newly&#8211;confirmed boys and girls, were included in the 43 communicants. I returned to Auckland for lunch.</p>
         <p>We motored to <hi rend="underline">Durham</hi>, and attended Evensong in the Cathedral.  I occupied the Throne, &amp; bestowed the Benediction on a large congregation, largely of holiday folk.  After tea with Lillingston, with whom was Charlie, we returned to Auckland, only to set out again for <hi rend="underline">Sedgefield</hi>, where I read the Lessons, and preached at evensong. I was surprized, and even annoyed, that no member of the Rector's family was present. That was hardly a good example to the parishioners, &amp; not very respectful to the Bishop. But in these days we may not wisely look for politeness or deference.</p>
