         <p>I worked again at the Article, but did very little. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Llewelyn</hi>, the Curate of New Shildon, came to see me. He is being offered something in the Leicester diocese, &amp; wished to consult me before deciding on his answer. I have no doubt his mind had been already made up!</p>

         <p>Captain <hi rend="doubleunderline">Stopford</hi> and his wife came to tea.  He is the newly appointed Secretary or Clark to Sherburn Hospital.  He is a square&#8211;built naval officer of the 'bull&#8211;dog breed', and has been employed at Rosyth.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I motored to Stockton, where I addrefsed a meeting of the League of Nations Union in the Borough Hall.  The Mayor presided over a meeting of 300&#8211;400 people.  The other speaker was the local member, a Labour fellow named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Riley</hi>.  I spoke badly, though I had been at the pains of preparing notes rather carefully.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Leonard Ropner</hi> proposed a vote of thanks which a Difsenting minister who said he had been at Gallipoli seconded, &amp;, of course, there was a collection.</p>
