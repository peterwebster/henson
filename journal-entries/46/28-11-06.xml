<hi rend="italic">Lionel and I motored to Burnopfield, where I instituted M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Ledger to the Vicarage.  The Church was crowded, &amp; an unusually large number of the local clergy attended.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I finished reading a book entitled â€“ 'The Rampant Age'.  It purports to be a true description of 'Young America', &amp; maybe taken as an illustration of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Judge Lindsay's</hi><hi rend="italic">', '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Revolt of Modern Youth</hi><hi rend="italic">'. It pictures the life of a lad at school and university during the years 16 to 19; &amp; is a record of the vulgarest debauchery, unrelieved by any touch of generosity. I was particularly impressed by the account of the actual working of the boasted "Co&#8211;ed" system. How far can this kind of composition be taken as convening an even&#8211;approximally just impression of the facts of American life? About as far as "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">The Loom of Youth</hi><hi rend="italic">" may be taken as a true picture of an English public school.  Both have the measure of truth which is present in every successful caricature. </hi>
