         <p>We left the Castle at 10.30 a.m., &amp; motored to Rode Hall by way of Barnard Castle, Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Wigan, Warrington, Northwich, (Great Budworth where we had tea, &amp; saw the church), Middlewich &amp; Congleton. We lunched very comfortably at Kendal in the County Hotel. The weather was brilliant, and the more enjoyable since the nip in the air reminded us that we are reaching the threshhold [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of winter. We arrived at Rode Hall about 6.45 p.m. The house party was predominantly youthful, and all charming. The younger folk went off to a dance, leaving their seniors to converse. In these ill days there is no lack of subjects on which to converse, but they are all woefully grave.</p>
