         <p>The fine weather gave place to a muggy mist and rain, very comfortless &amp; demoralizing. We attended the morning session, &amp; heard the papers of three foreigners. Of these the Greek was carefully non committal: the Dane , strong &amp; straightforward: the German, rhetorical &amp; embarrassed. All were much applauded, though, perhaps, none were completely understood. After lunching with the Bishop, we left Cheltenham, &amp; motored to Carlton on Trent (165 miles) by way of Evesham, Stratford, Coventry, Nottingham, &amp; Newark. We started at 1.45 p.m., &amp; arrived at 7.30 p.m., stopped at Ashby&#8211;de&#8211;la&#8211;Zouche for half an hour.</p>
         <p>The clergyman, a neighbouring incumbent, who had been preaching the sermon at the Harvest Festival, dined here.  He said that two new pits were being opened in his parish, &amp; that 900 houses were immediately to be built for the accommodation of the miners.  I inquired whether any of the unemployed Durham pitmen were coming in, &amp; he replied that most of the men came from Wales.  He said that he had a staff of three priests, &amp; could supply their spiritual needs.  </p>
