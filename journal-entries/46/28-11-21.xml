<hi>I motored to Durham, and licensed two clergy in the Castle, as well as instituted Thompson to the vicarage of Heatherycleugh, and P.Y. Knight to an honorary Canonry. Then I lunched with Wilson in the County Club, and afterwards had an interview with that grotesque blend of imbecility and conceit, Glynne, the Vicar of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Cuthbert's Durham.  He complains bitterly of his treatment at the hands of certain members of his Parochial Church Council.  They seem to have criticized somewhat sharply his finances.  I told him that he ought to have nothing to do with parochial finance.  When he had gone, I had interviews with two youths, now students at S</hi><hi rend="superscript">t. </hi><hi>John's College, &amp; approved them for grants from the Clergy Training Board.    Then I discussed matters with my suffragan.  At 4.30 p.m. I received in my rooms at the Castle a deputation from Holy Trinity, Stockton, which desired to inform me as to the needs of that parish, to which I must send a new Vicar.  I gave them tea, &amp; then discussed the matter with them.  We motored to Firtree (Howden&#8211;le&#8211;Wear), where I instituted the Rev. E.E. Pearson to the incumbency.  There was a crowded, &amp; very attentive congregation. </hi>
