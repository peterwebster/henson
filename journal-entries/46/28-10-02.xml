<hi rend="doubleunderline">The Church Congress, Cheltenham.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We motored into Cheltenham in good time to form up for the Procession to the Churches. The principal or official procession went to S. Matthew's Church, a large modern Church accommodating 1500 people, almost all on the floor. It was completely filled. Jack Clayton acted as my Chaplain. My sermon was closely listened to, &amp; was, I think, well heard save in the Chancel, where the Bishop sate.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi> delivered his Address as President.  It was rather too long &amp; discursive, but contained much good sense &amp; some striking sentences.  Its tone, perhaps, was a little too dictatorial &amp; omniscient.  At the evening session the papers were historical by Whitney, Watson, &amp; Jenkins, &amp; all good, though not well heard.  <hi rend="bold underline">I was considerably applauded when I got up to read my paper, &amp; when I sate down after reading it.</hi>  Two short speeches by Lord Hugh Cecil &amp; Major Birchall ended the meeting.</p>
