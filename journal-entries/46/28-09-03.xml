         <p>A man, fearing that he was on his deathbed, sent for an acquaintance with whom he had fallen out years before, and made overtures of peace. They shook hands in amity. But as the other left the room, the sick man roused himself to say, "<hi rend="underline">Remember, if I get over this, the old quarrel stands</hi>". </p>

         <p>I finished the sermon for the Winlaton Centenary.  In the afternoon I motored to Newcastle, and had my hair cut &amp;c.  It badly needed the artist's attention!  </p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Carter</hi> informs me that he has sent the pamphlet of my '<hi rend="underline">Reflections on the Crisis</hi>' to all the clerical and lay members of the Assembly.</p>
         <p>A certain <hi rend="doubleunderline">Colonel Nicholson</hi> sent me 'with most respectful compliments' a skit on the proposal to ordain women.  It represents two lady chaplains in military dress trying to conduct a parade service in a gale.  The garrison orders include the announcement that "any laughing in the ranks during divine Service will be severely dealt with".</p>
