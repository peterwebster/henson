<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Middleton</hi> writes to me in acknowledgement of my 'Reflections on the Crisis', &amp; making some comments.  He ends thus:&#8211;</p>
         <p>Forgive my intruding this on your valuable time, &amp; accept my regrets, which are shared by many, that <hi rend="bold underline">the call has not come to you to remove further South, which at one time before the decision in July seemed very probable, and made us full of hope</hi>."</p>
         <p>I motored to Durham, lunched with the Bishop of Jarrow &amp; arranged many things with him, presided at the meeting of the Board of Finance, and then went on to Sunderland, where I dedicated the new vestries at S. Barnabas Church &amp; preached a sermon. Then I had tea with M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Petrie, &amp; talked with the clergy who had gathered at the Vicarage.  After this I picked up Ella at the Rectory, &amp; returned with her to Auckland.</p>
         <p>My sermon this afternoon was a poor little address on the uses of a Vestry based on the words of S. Paul in I Cor: xiv "<hi rend="underline">Let all things be done decently &amp; in order</hi>". I was able to say some necessary things about ill&#8211;discipline of choirs &amp; dirty surplices.</p>
