         <p>I motored to Darlington, and took train for Bristol where I arrived about 5 p.m., &amp; was met by the car, &amp; driven to the Palace.  The 'mass meeting of Churchmen' in the Coulston Hall was an impressive gathering of more than 2000 men â€“ women were excluded.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Colonel Oldham</hi> and I were the chosen speakers.  He spoke first, and was dreadfully confused &amp; dreary.  Moreover, he went on at such length that he had to be 'pulled down' by the Bishop.  I spoke for half an hour, and was well listened to, but I did not speak well.  The truth is that I am too much worried to be able to anything well.  This annual meeting is organized by the C.E.M.S. and <hi rend="underline">costs </hi>about &#x00A3;80. Is it worth the money?</p>

<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Canon Sewell</hi><hi rend="italic">, the diocesan missioner, told me that his brother had married </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Maggie Marsden</hi><hi rend="italic">, </hi><hi rend="i bold">that she was now a widow, &amp; living in Switzerland</hi><hi rend="italic">.  What a stream of reminiscence her name sets in flow!  The </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lady Hypalia</hi><hi rend="italic">, as I fondly called her, kept house for her uncle Marsden, Vicar of Chigwell, &amp; I often saw her.</hi>
