         </p>
         <p>The morning was brilliant, and the Chapel looked glorious. A number of the clergy attended, &amp; formed a choir. I myself acted as the Preacher required by the Rubrick. Two men only were ordained, both to the Diaconate. The service occupied no more than an hour &amp; 20 minutes. I got some speech with the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; Wallis. The latter told me that his action in voting for the Revised Prayer Book had brought down on his head much venomous abuse from his Evangelical friends. Most of the clergy &amp; the friends of the candidates stayed to lunch.Ã©</p>
         <p>Then Ella's party gathered in force. I talked and walked for two hours. Old Lady Bell and a cranky American named, I think, Robbins, went into the chapel &amp; State&#8211;room with me.</p>
         <p>Sir Evelyn and Lady Cecil arrived for a short visit. They had motored from Sauchiburn, and reported that Sir Arthur Steele&#8211;Maitland was now fairly recovered. Hospitality is an episcopal duty, &amp; these are welcome guests, but any guests, however welcome, are hard to fit in to one's work!</p>
