<hi rend="doubleunderline">Rode Hall to the Palace, Gloucester.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Another brilliant autumnal morning, with the sun shining brightly over a frost&#8211;whitened landscape, in which the verdure of the trees was beginning to yield to the russets, reds, &amp; yellows of the Fall.</p>
         <p>We left Rode Hall about 10.45 a.m. &amp; motored to Gloucester by way of Newcastle&#8211;under&#8211;Lyne, Market Drayton, Wallington, Bridgnorth [sic], Kidderminster, Hartlebury, Worcester, &amp; Tewkesbury, arriving at 4 p.m.  We stopped at Hartlebury Castle, &amp; lunched with the Bishop.  We were received at the Palace in Gloucester by Miss Maud Headlam.  There were staying at the Palace Professor <hi rend="doubleunderline">Deissmann</hi> and a Danish Bishop.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Rose Headlam</hi>, &amp; a former Bible&#8211;Clerk, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lewis Headlam</hi>, made up the palatial party. After dinner we all motored to Cheltenham, &amp; attended the Mayor's reception. I endured this horrible "perpendicular" for an hour, &amp; then we returned to Gloucester. A number of people claimed to know me, whom I neither knew nor cared to know. Jack Clayton was there.</p>
