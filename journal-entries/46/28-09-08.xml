         <p> In 1789, but a few years before the explosion that shattered the ecclesiastical system of France, the assembly of the French clergy thought it necessary solemnly to deplore &amp; condemn the partial tolerance that had been accorded to the French Protestants, &amp; to petition the King that no further privileges might be granted them.</p>

         <p>I worked at the Congress Paper, but with small success. After lunch, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi> motored me to Brandon where I had heard that the Vicar was seriously ill.  I found him in bed, &amp; said prayers with him.</p>
         <p>Later, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lione</hi>l motored me to New Shildon, where I saw the Vicar, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Morris Young</hi><persName xml:id="5580"></persName>, in bed. He has a sudden breakdown, &amp;, from what his wife tells me, I fear that he is very ill indeed.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">Brandon</hi> has 16000 parishioners, &amp; <hi rend="underline">New Shildon</hi> 7000.  There are 5 clergy all together, an average of 4,600 per parson.</p>
