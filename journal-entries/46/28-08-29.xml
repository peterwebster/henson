         <p>The post brought me a letter from Lord Joicey enclosing a cheque for &#x00A3;5000 towards the Castle Preservation Fund. So my 'heart&#8211;to&#8211;heart' talk was not wholly without effect.</p>
         <p>We left the house about 11 a.m., &amp; motored by way of Kelso to Hawick, where we lunched with M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Forman Campbell Fraser's sister, a widow&#8211;lady, who lives in a pleasant house 905 feet above sea&#8211;level about 4 miles out of Hawick.  A local manufacturer, Sir Thomas Henderson &amp; his wife, and some other neighbours formed the party.  We returned by a shorter route, having tea on the way.  The weather which had been fine changed for the worse.  Altogether we motored for 97 miles.  After arriving home, I wrote a number of letters.</p>
         <p>Henry Dobson came to consult me about the proposal which, he said, the Principal of Bede College had made to him, viz. that he should accept appointment as Chaplain to that Institution. He felt that he had not enough to do at Hutton Henry, &amp; thought that he ought to have more work. I bade him refuse the Chaplaincy.</p>
