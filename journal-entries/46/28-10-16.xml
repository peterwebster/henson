         </p>
         <p>We motored to Durham by way of Windlestone in order to pick up Sybil, Lady Eden, on the way. There we attended the funeral of Archdeacon Derry. The whole service save only the graveside prayers was rendered in the cathedral where a large congregation, including many clergy in their surplices, assembled. Then we proceeded to Bow Cemetery, where I read the prayers at the graveside. Then we returned to Auckland for lunch.</p>
         <p>After lunch I had an interview with Surtees, the Rector of Brancepeth with reference to the appointment of a successor to Hayward as Vicar of Brandon, of which Surtees is patron.</p>
         <p>Then Brooke &amp; I walked round the Park. The colouring of the trees was brilliant, but the weather had become oppressively warm.</p>
         <p>Jimmie Dobson came to tea, &amp; afterwards had some talk with me.</p>
         <p>The youth, Bainbridge, brought his picture of the chapel, a woeful daub, but I paid him two guineas for it!</p>
