         <p>We tell our Lord God plainly: If he will have his Church, then he must look how to maintain and defend it: for we can neither uphold nor protect it.  And well for us, that it is so!  For in case we could, or were able to defend it, we should become the proudest asses under heaven.  Who is the church's protector, that hath promised to be with her to the end, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her?   King, Diets, Parliaments, Lawyers?  Marry, no such cattle. </p>
         <p>Luther's Table Talk.</p>
         <p>I received a letter from William dated from Buluwayo. (P.O. Box 440) Most of the morning I worked at the Congress Sermon but with poor result. I am not sure whether I am venting absurdities or elaborating platitudes! The morning papers contain the correspondance between Lord Joicey &amp; myself, &amp; announce his donation of &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">5000</hi>.  I wrote to Lacey asking for information on the casuistic point raised by the Bishop of Bombay â€“ might Christians deserted by apostatizing partners hold themselves free to marry again?  Lacey is fanatical &amp; pedantic, but on most questions omniscient. </p>
