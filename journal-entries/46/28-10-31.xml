         <p>I spent the morning in visiting the ancient City of Bristol. The Bishop showed me the very magnificent building of the University. It is the creation of the wealth of Wills, the tobacco magnate. After calling vainly on the Dean, who was occupied in presiding at a Chapter meeting, I went to that most glorious of parish churches, S. Mary, Radcliffe. A young man, seemingly an official, recognized me, and with much deference showed me the many interesting features of the Church. The late (transitional) Norman porch with the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century octagon are very remarkable.</p>
         <p>I travelled to Oxford by the afternoon train, and, after depositing my bags at All Souls, went to the hair&#8211;dresser, and had my hair cut. I dined with Frank and his wife. There was no other company. Our conversation necessarily travelled over the dreary subject of ecclesiastical controversy. I speedily realized how profound was the alienation from the Church of both my host &amp; my hostess!</p>
