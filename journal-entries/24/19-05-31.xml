<hi>"The Enabling Bill is meeting with an increasing volume of opposition. Men who were in favour of it now declare their opposition, &amp; if only the case against it were stated effectively in the Lords next week we should hear no more about it….

<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Potter</hi><hi>, now a master at the Cathedral school came to see me.

So I had a grave talk with her about the same. They both made peaceful declarations, but I think it is a case of incompatible temperaments, and a discord of women! <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I motored into the country, and paid some calls.

He said that I was just the same to look at, but greyer!</hi>

<hi>The weather continues bright and warm. There are signs of actual drought, &amp; the farmers begin to look anxious. It is more than commonly difficult to keep one's self to any work within doors, &amp; out of doors the very notion of work is repulsive!</hi>

<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Muir Mackenzie</hi><persName xml:id="601"></persName><hi rend="italic"> writes to propose a visit next week. He mentions the 2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="italic">reading debate of [^the^] Enabling Bill, and adds "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">if there are not too many other speakers I shall have a say</hi><hi rend="italic">". Here is yet another Scotchman interesting himself in the fate of the Church of England! Can it be the case that the Church has fallen so completely out of touch with the English people that, in this hour of fate, none is to be found who cares what way befall it? "Democracy", the cant of the hour, accords ill with the hierarchical principle, which must needs govern the arrangements of an episcopal church: and, though there are many Socialists among the inferior clergy, the discord between the root–ideas of Socialism and Christianity is too profound to be easily bridged, if bridged at all. The "Via media" is unpalatable, and indeed almost unintelligible to our zealots of the sacristies.</hi>
