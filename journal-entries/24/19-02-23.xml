<hi>I attended Mattins in the Cathedral, and stayed to the Holy Communion. There was an immense congregation. The sermon – an exhortation to unselfishness – was preached by a Minor Canon named Besley<persName xml:id="4722"></persName>. Lady Londonderry<persName xml:id="2817"></persName> was there. After lunch I walked with Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName>. On Lambeth Bridge we saw a boy fall from the iron–work. He lay so still that we feared the worst. I hastened to S. Thomas's Hospital but they referred me to the Police. Having found a constable I sent him on to the scene of the disaster in a taxi, but aid had already arrived from the West</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">mr</hi><hi> side, &amp; the boy had been removed to that Hospital. I went to the Cathedral at 7 p.m. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Barnes<persName xml:id="3581"></persName> preached an excellent sermon, well–planned, well–phrased, and well–delivered. He has a considerable voice which, as I judge, carried well over the building. There was a great congregation</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> He came in to supper. He had detected my hand in the articles on the Church in the "Times".</hi><hi rend="italic"> Rather to my surprise he had not seen before the well–known quotation from Burke which I set at the head of the second article. Unfortunately he is not a member of the Representative Church Council. Influenza will certainly keep away a good many of my supporters, but nothing but sheer necessity will hold back my opponents. It is the Jesuits v. the Medieval Church!</hi>
