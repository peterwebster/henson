<hi>I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; wrote two letters – </hi><hi rend="bold underline">to Geoffrey Dawson<persName xml:id="2709"></persName> applauding his resignation of the Editorship of the "Times"</hi><hi rend="bold">, </hi><hi> and<note xml:id="459" n="1"></note> to Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> a "Collins".<note xml:id="460" n="2"></note> Then I chartered a taxi, picked up <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> at the Deanery and went to Paddington, where we caught the 1.30 p.m. train to Hereford. A pneumatic coupling broke, &amp; was repaired at Oxford. This incident made us arrive in Hereford half an hour late. <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> was waiting for me, and did the letters that could not wait. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">After dinner a South African soldier called on me with respect to Ordination. He had been a Wesleyan lay&#8211;preacher &amp; probationer before the War</hi><hi rend="bold">,</hi><hi> but had resigned his position in the denomination on conscientious grounds. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He could not endorse John Wesley's Sermons! But he is 35 years of age, and intends to fulfil his ministry in South Africa, where he was born. I pointed out that the right course would be for him to apply for Ordination to one of the South African bishops</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi> He seemed apprehensive of their rejecting him on the score of unsoundness. I could not hold out much hope of considerate handling of conscientious scruples in that narrow &amp; bigoted sect, which arrogates the Anglican name in South Africa!</hi>
