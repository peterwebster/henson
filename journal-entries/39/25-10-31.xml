         <p>Men in all ages have been so desirous to know the effect of their purposes, the sequel of things to come, and to see the end of their fear and hope, that a silly witch, which had learned anything in the art of cozenage, may make a great many jolly fools.</p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Amery</hi> sent me long letter in response to my inquiry about Kenya: he also enclosed divers official papers on the subject. <hi rend="doubleunderline">D'Argent&#8211;Bell</hi>, lately vicar of Monkheseldon S. Mary's, now Vicar of Muggleswick, sent me 3 rose&#8211;trees from his wonderful rose&#8211;garden at Monkheseldon, perforce abandoned, as that house is not to be retained as the Vicarage of the united parish. I spent most part of the day in writing a sermon for use at Stranton tomorrow. In the afternoon I walked round the Park, &amp; looked on at a Football Match. On returning to my study I completed my Sermon. But how woefully different is this preaching, to which as Bishop I am perforce condemned, to the preaching which was my normal duty as a parish clergyman! Then the people knew me, &amp; I knew them. Now I speak to strangers. Then I could teach, now it is all a matter of stunts &amp; impressions!</p></body></text></TEI>
