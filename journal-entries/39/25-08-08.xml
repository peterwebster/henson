         <p>The age in which Wolsey lived was immoral in the sense in which all periods are immoral, when the old landmarks are disappearing and there is no certainty about the future.</p>

After dinner I wrote to Hal Vere Lawrie, congratulating him on passing the examination for Sandhurst. Also, I wrote to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>. Macdonald sent me a photograph of Bishop Lightfoot<persName xml:id="1817"></persName> extracted from one of the groups of the Sons of the House.</p></body></text></TEI>
