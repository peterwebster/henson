         <p>Tony Chute and Jack Boden<persName xml:id="2936"></persName> went off together after breakfast. I settled down to writing the necessary letters, and then wrote and despatched an article on the Thirty&#8211;nine Articles for the <hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi>. This is the 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> that I have written. The subjects have been the following:&#8211;</p>
         <p>1. The Church Assembly</p>
         <p>2. The Parson in Parliament.</p>
         <p>3. Disestablishment</p>
         <p>4. The Coal Industry.</p>
         <p>5. Tennessee</p>
         <p>6. The Thirty&#8211;nine Articles.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Brooke Westcott</hi><persName xml:id="5385"></persName> played bowls, and had tea with me, while <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, &amp; Fawkes<persName xml:id="1082"></persName> went into Durham.</p>
         <p>The "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>" prints a long communication from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Shaftesbury</hi> as President of the E.C.U.<orgName xml:id="20"></orgName> conveying to the Archbishop of Canterbury a Report on a recent sermon by the Bishop of Birmingham<persName xml:id="3581"></persName> prepared by "<hi rend="underline">the Theological &amp; Liturgical Committee of the Union</hi>". It is a very insolent document, treating the Bishop as if he were an ignorant curate, &amp; posing as peaceful Christians who have been goaded to exasperation by the unprovoked attacks of a heretical prelate! The Archbishop replies in a very civil, non&#8211;committal letter. <hi rend="underline">He ought to have rapped them over the knuckles for their impudence.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
