         <p>At the Reformation, the first reformers were beset with an almost morbid anxiety not to be considered heretical in point of doctrine. They knew that the Romanticists were on the watch to fasten the brand of heresy upon them whenever a fair pretext could be found: &amp; I have no doubt it was the excess of this fear which at once led to the burning of Servetus, &amp; also to the thanks offered by all the Protestant Churches, to Calvin &amp; the Church of Geneva, for burning him.</p>

         <p>I worked on the chapter which deals with 'Exorcism', but partly, perhaps, on account of a heavy cold I achieved little. Rayne, his wife, and a Norwegian girl, who is staying with them, came to lunch, and, very rashly, I showed them the Castle, making my cold worse in the process. Then I walked in the Park â€“ another folly.</p>
