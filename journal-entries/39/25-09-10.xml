         <p>No longer I complain</p>
         <p>That knowledge brings no joy,</p>
         <p>That all the art I gain</p>
         <p>Is cunning to destroy.</p>
         <p>Destroyers, we create;</p>

         <p>These sinister lines are placed, not unfitly at the beginning of <hi rend="doubleunderline">G. D. H. Cole's</hi> sinister book, '<hi rend="underline">Labour in the Commonwealth, A Book for the Younger Generation</hi>'. I wasted the day in reading through this precious production. It is a sophisticated plea for the class&#8211;war. The author was a Fellow of Magdalen, yet he doesn't scruple to excuse the abject folly which advocates "class education". There can be no doubt that this poisonous doctrine is spreading. Yesterday, the Trade&#8211;Union Conference adopted a resolution affirming the theory of Communism. The much&#8211;vaunted good&#8211;sense of English working&#8211;men has not been apparent lately.</p>
