         <p>The "Church Times" makes my last article in "the Evening Standard" the text of a rather abrasive leader headed "The Durham Bourbon". It will please many of the clergy. &amp; possibly occasion another spate of rudeness.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning in working at the Halifax sermon, and then, after an early lunch, went to Durham by train, and walked to Bede College, where I presided at a meeting of the Governors. Brayley, the new Principal, gave a rather lurid account of the state of the students, of whom there are 124, mostly in a grave state of relaxed discipline. He seems determined to work a reformation.</p>

"The unauthorized introduction of this Roman practice is proving a divisive force among ourselves," says the American prelate.</p></body></text></TEI>
