         <p>I called on the old Vicar, Boyce, and had some talk with him in his garden. His mind is now set on his approaching retirement. His flock, some 530 in number, does not seem to pay much attention to his spiritual message. Only one farmer comes to the church, and but few of the labourers. Miles assures me that the morals of the village youths is [sic] deplorable. They make no secret of their immorality, which, indeed, they assume to be a matter of course. They like the old Vicar, but never come to church. All this is a sad commentary on the Church of England, as a power in the country where she has monopoly of church and school.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, we (i.e. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Miles, &amp; I) motored to Sherington, &amp; called on Lady Elizabeth Smith, who gave us tea, &amp; showed us her younger children.</p>
         <p>Lord Cheylesmore's death is announced. He was Mayor of Westminster while I was Rector of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's, and made me his Chaplain. At that time he lived in Hughenden Manor, and I remember going there to a garden&#8211;party, and seeing the house which had been made famous by its association with two great statesmen â€“ Edmund Burke and Benjamin Disraeli. It were difficult to find two more different men.</p></body></text></TEI>
