         <p>Mine host accompanied me to the station, where I caught the 10.15a.m. train to London. We took so much time in getting out of the fog&#8211;belt in which Leeds was held, that the train ran into King's Cross about half an hour after the scheduled time. The Bishop of Wakefield was on board. We joined in lamenting the object which drew us to London, &amp; he quoted Mageo's words to Archbishop Benson when his Grace rebuked his absenteeism from Convocation. "<hi rend="underline">Why should I join in splitting the few hairs left to the Church of England</hi>?" I left my bags in Park Lane, and then we went to the hair&#8211;dresser. Then I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. Sir Thomas Barlow was in the Club. He thanked me for the copy of my 'Notes', &amp; expressed his approval of my attitude. Oman<persName xml:id="2141"></persName> and I dined together in the Club. He says that the College on All Souls Day elected to Fellowships two County&#8211;council Scholars, both aged only 21, and both deeply affected by the crude Socialism which marks their class. He thought that life in All Souls would probably effect a change in their outlook on life. This is, perhaps, certain, but what the change will be is incalculable.</p></body></text></TEI>
