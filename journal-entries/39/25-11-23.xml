         <p>It is yet too soon to estimate the Gift to Mankind which at so great a cost the Allies, who fought together I the Great War, bestowed. Only when the vast Tragedy can be seen in the perspective of History can its moral significance be justly measured. But if Freedom be the primary condition of self&#8211;respect, alike for Nations and for Men, the immense sacrifice of Life was not excessive, &amp; Humanity saved its soul in those terrible years.</p>

         <p>I wrote the above as "une pense&#x00E9; autographe de reconnaissance &#x00E0; l'&#x00E9;gard des Anciens Combattants Alli&#x00E9;s", which some association in Paris has bothered me to contribute.</p>
         <p>I wrote many letters both official and private, and walked round the Park during the afternoon. But I was not feeling well enough to do any serious work, and generally felt chilled. The Queen's funeral on Friday next is causing the postponement of many functions, including the prize&#8211;giving at Blyth, which I had promised to perform.</p></body></text></TEI>
