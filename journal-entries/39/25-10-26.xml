         <p><hi rend="bold">Monday, October 26</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1925.</hi></p>
         <p>The weather was stormy and very wet. I devoted the morning to writing an article for the <hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi>, taking for my subject '<hi rend="underline">The decline of Preaching</hi>', a subject suggested by the Archbishop of Canterbury's sermon at the recent Church Congress. This article I finished, &amp; sent off to the Editor.</p>
         <p>After lunch I went in to Durham, and presided at a meeting of the Church Building Board. After this was over, I had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName>, and discussed with him some diocesan business. A young man named Unwin, a student in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's College, came to see me with a view to being accepted as a candidate for the Advent Ordination. I was favourably impressed by him. Then I returned to Auckland, and <hi rend="bold underline">wrote a letter of condolence to Lady Struthers, whose husband's<persName xml:id="2244"></persName> death is reported in today's issue of the </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Times</hi><hi rend="bold underline">. He was no more than 68 years old</hi>, but he had been failing for some time past, and I was not altogether surprised to hear of his death.</p>
         <p>I received a certain number of polite acknowledgments from the bishops to whom I had sent copies of my "<hi rend="underline">Notes on Spiritual Healing</hi>". But they make no comments worth my heeding, being no doubt too fearful of committing themselves! Bishops are a timorous crew at best. Mostly they know too little to dare to have opinions of their own on any subject.</p></body></text></TEI>
