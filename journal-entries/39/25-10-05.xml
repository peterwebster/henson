         <p>When learning, abilities, and what is excellent in the world forsake the church, we may easily foretell its ruin, without the gift of prophecy. And when ignorance succeeds in the place of learning, weakness in the room of judgement, we may be sure heresy and confusion will quickly come in the room of religion: for undoubtedly there is no way so effectual to betray the truth, as to procure it a weak defender.</p>

         <p>I wasted the day in writing a rash &amp; foolish article on "<hi rend="underline">Conferences</hi>" for the "Evening Standard", which I sent off by the afternoon post. In the afternoon I went in to Durham, and saw the Archdeacons. The woeful ex&#8211;Vicar attended all the services, but made no attempt to take part in them. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Booth</hi>, the curate&#8211;in&#8211;charge of the district which has been carved out of Cleadon, came to be licensed, &amp; to stay the night. I promised to contribute &#x00A3;20 towards his new church. He seems to be settling down to his work in a sensible &amp; sanguine temper, which promises well.</p></body></text></TEI>
