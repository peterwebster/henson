         <p>I spent the whole morning in writing letters, &amp; preparing a short address for the Conference tomorrow. I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lloyd&#8211;Thomas</hi>, thanking him for his edition of Baxter's <hi rend="underline">Autobiography, </hi>of which he had sent me a copy. In the afternoon I walked round the Park, having as my companion D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> McCullagh</hi>, to whom I gave a copy of my 'Notes'. I learned from a paragraph in the "<hi rend="underline">Church Times</hi>", that my article on "<hi rend="underline">the Decline of Preaching</hi>" had appeared in the "<hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi>". The Editor of the letters wrote to suggest that I should write on <hi rend="doubleunderline">Inge's</hi> pronouncement in the newly&#8211;published volume on "Science, Religion, &amp; Reality". Accordingly, I read through the said pronouncement, &amp; found it amazingly clever, and quite superfluously irritating to the orthodox vulgar. </p>
         <p>Angel Thelwall<persName xml:id="1812"></persName> arrived by the afternoon train. She is unalterably childish. </p></body></text></TEI>
