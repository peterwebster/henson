         <p>The extent to which the supply of Ordination candidates may be affected by the decline of the Birth&#8211;rate among the clergy, whose sons have in the past provided many &amp; the best candidates, is, perhaps, illustrated by the circumstance that the Bishops, who are probably representative in this respect of the clergy as a whole are largely celibate and childless:&#8211;</p>

         <p>Here are no less than 17 bishops out of 37 who are childless. Take such a proportion throughout the clergy, &amp; it will be apparent that the hereditary character of the clerical profession is not being maintained. It is probably true that the proportion of unmarried &amp; childless men in the upper&#8211;middle class is not less among the lay than among the clerical element.</p>
