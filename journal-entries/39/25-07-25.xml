         <p>Before leaving Riccall, I went with mine host to the Church, and renewed my memory of the very fine late Norman doorway, which is not unworthy of comparison with Iffley. We started about 10a.m., and motored by way of Doncaster, Retford, &amp; Grantham to Peterborough where we lunched at the Palace. The Bishop, (Bardsley) is a good, kind, conventional, gushing Evangelical. He and his wife received us with kindness. After looking into the Cathedral, which, though grandiose, is not, like Durham majestic, we resumed our journey, and motored by way of Wisbeach, Kings Lynn, East Dereham, Norwich, &amp; Bungary to Bramfield in Suffold, where we arrived shortly after 8p.m., a full hour after the arranged time: but with the distance greater than we had reckoned _ 116 miles from Riccall to Peterborough, 110 miles from Peterborough to Bramfield, altogether 226 miles, which allowing for the intervals of lunch at Peterborough 1 1/2 hours, &amp; for tea at King's Lynn 1/2 an hour, we traversed in 8 hours, an average pace of merely 26 miles, which is not bad _ and we lost time in getting through Doncaster and Norwich. Village sports were still proceeding in a field opposite the Hall gates at Bramfield when we arrived &amp; were welcomed by Lady Thompson &amp; Miles.</p></body></text></TEI>
