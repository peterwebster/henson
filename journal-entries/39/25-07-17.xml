         <p>My Lord of London by experience feeleth and seeth the marks and bounds of these good sprights which, but for his toleration had been supressed 5 or 6 years ago, and had prevented all this unquietness now taken, and both his reputation better saved and my poor honesty not so foully traduced.</p>

He seemed more favourably disposed towards the faithâ€“healer. I motored to Ingleton, &amp; instituted Suthrien<persName xml:id="5364"></persName> to the Vicarage. The little church was filled with parishioners, and there was a good muster of Suthrien's clerical friends. J. G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> stayed the night.</p></body></text></TEI>
