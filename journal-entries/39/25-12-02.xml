         <p>I began the day absurdly enough by being photographed! The local photographer, who enjoys a reputation for ability, came here, &amp; photographed me robed in the great chair, and in mufti in my study, and at the entrance of the Castle. This foolish proceeding inaugurated fitly another wasted day. I read through the accounts in the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> of the signing of the Locarno Treaties yesterday. The compliments paid to our new K.G. are enough to turn anyman's [sic] head. He must have diplomatic and personal qualities which few of us suspected.</p>
         <p>I left the Castle at 3.30 p.m. and motored to Barnard Castle, where I attended a meeting of the Bedekirk Trustees, which the old "benefactor", M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Richardson, insisted on having convoked. Later, I went to the meeting of the local League of Nations Union, and delivered an oration. There was a good attendance, which reflected credit on the Papist Secretary, Wiseman. The chairman was a youngish local doctor named Leishmann, who impressed me favourably. I got away about 8.45 p.m., and was back at Auckland about 9.35 p.m. There was little snow about Barnard Castle.</p>
