         <p><hi rend="italic">I left Oxford at 10.50 a.m. and travelled without change to Darlington, where I arrived about 4.30 p.m. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; Leng met me with the car, &amp; carried me to the Castle. There, among the letters awaiting my arrival, was a truly grievous communication from the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName>, coarging the materials of another melancholy &amp; scandalous disciplinary case. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">We have the treasure in earthen vessels</hi><hi rend="italic">". The past is brought home with terrible emphasis by the moral collapse of a clergyman who has for years carried on an apparently faithful ministry. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall"</hi><hi rend="italic">. The Park&#8211;keeper reports his capture of two men stealing coal from the park.

The "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">" has a report of a speech by the </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Abbe Portal</hi><hi rend="italic"> made in Brussels at a Congress on Church Union.
