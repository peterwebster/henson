         <p><hi rend="bold">Friday, May 29</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1925.</hi></p>
         <p>A wet blustering day and very chilly throughout! I wasted the day in composing a letter to the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> in support of Lord Durham's<persName xml:id="3462"></persName> Appeal for the Castle. This I accompanied by a private letter to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dawson</hi>. Also, I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Lewis Dibden</hi><persName xml:id="909"></persName> asking him to use his influence with the Commissioners to get a grant for the Castle Fund. I went in to Durham, and attended Evensong in the cathedral. After the service had ended I led the procession to the top of the central Tower, and listened to the three anthems, which, according to custom, are sung there on this day. I gave the precentor a pound for the choirboys. Then I had tea with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi><persName xml:id="62"></persName>, and discussed with him many matters of diocesan business. Scarcely had I returned to Auckland before <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie</hi><persName xml:id="3572"></persName> appeared. He looks very thin and over&#8211;wrought. I gave him "<hi rend="underline">John Inglesant</hi>" as a Birthday present. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Alexander</hi><persName xml:id="5214"></persName> reports that <hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi> has obtained a good situation, and that he must look out for another butler's boy. This, of course, is well enough. Nevertheless, I dislike changes in the household: &amp; William had commended himself to me, so that I shall regret his departure.</p></body></text></TEI>
