         <p>The woeful man who has resigned Newbottle wrote to pray me that he might be suffered to work in Tyneside, where he was known, &amp; no explanations were needed, but I wrote in reply that this might nowise be granted, seeing that men would be led to think that his offence was but a slight matter. Later, I motored into Durham, and showed the letter to my Suffragan before posting it. I had tea in the Castle, and talked there with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Stead</hi>, the Curate of Langley Park, who is restive &amp; meditates returning to the colony from which he came. I fell in with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mead Faulkner</hi><persName xml:id="3553"></persName> in Palace Yard, &amp; walked with him. He is still very debilitated. On returning to Auckland, I resumed work on Tyndale, &amp; came across a hostile description of Bishop Turnstall – "<hi rend="underline">still Saturn that so seldom speaketh but walketh up &amp; down all day musing &amp; imagining mischief – a ducking hypocrite made to dissemble</hi>" – which yet has the ring of truth about it. Arrowsmith came to dine and sleep.</p></body></text></TEI>
