         <p>The Labour leaders are evidently alarmed by the proceedings at Scarborough. They fear the effect on the public mind of the Demonstration that they do not really represent "Labour". Thomas and Clynes are as significantly silent during its sessions.</p>
         <p>I motored to Durham, and licensed curates in the chapel of the Castle. Then I lunched with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, and returned to Auckland, carrying Lazenby<persName xml:id="3135"></persName> with me, Raine<persName xml:id="5371"></persName> &amp; his wife bringing with them his brother, architect from Canada, &amp; his sister&#8211;in&#8211;law came to see the Castle &amp; have tea. Scarcely had they departed, before we (i.e. Lazenby, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; I) motored to Cockfield in the parish of Staindrop, &amp; there I consecrated an addition to the burial&#8211;ground. A most beautiful rainbow illuminated the scene. In a short address I took occasion to speak contemptuously of the earthen ware erections &amp; glass globes. These monstrosities were numerously represented in the Cockfield cemetery! We returned to Auckland in time for dinner. <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> deaf relative, Augusta Sellar, arrived to dine &amp; sleep. She is almost inaccessible to spoken words!</p></body></text></TEI>
