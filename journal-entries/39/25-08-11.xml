         <p>I sent my three guests in the car to High Force and settled down to writing letters until Graham White came to see me about the situation at Dawdon. His account left me in no doubt as to the soundness of my decision not to appoint the curate to that living.</p>
         <p>The afternoon post brought me a letter from the Scottish youth, whose acquaintance I made in the railway between Darlington and King's Cross.</p>
         <p>I fulfilled my promise to the chauffeur at Bramfield by sending him a copy of 'Ivanhoe'.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Fawkes<persName xml:id="1082"></persName> read through the proof of "Notes on Spiritual Healing", and expressed very emphatic approval, especially of their "cold common sense" which, he thought, would be highly offensive to most of my episcopal confr&#x00E8;res</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I wonder whether this will be the case. It is, perhaps, true that I have so little personal intercourse with the religious world, (apart, of course, from the courses of daily duty,) that I am comparatively unfamiliar with its phrases and points of view. And it is also true that I am so entirely out of with the prevailing tendencies within the Church of England, that I can hardly speak of them acceptably!</p></body></text></TEI>
