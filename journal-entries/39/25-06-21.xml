         <p>O God the Holy Ghost, who hast called us to this place in Thy service, as Thou God began Thy work, so also continue and finish it in us. Save us from our besetting sins, from pride and bitterness, and faintness of heart, from sloth and self&#8211;deceit, and the curse of an unsubdued will: and grant us to know and to follow, to do and to suffer Thy Will, Who with the Father and the Son livest and reignest one God, for ever. Amen.</p>

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. Then I made a copy of Dean Church's prayer and sent it to J. After breakfast I wrote to George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, &amp; prepared notes for the Confirmation &amp; Preaching later in the day. Also I finished the Halifax sermon, &amp; wrote to Bishop Frodsham. The good man asked for 3 copies of my discourse for the newspapers! but the discourse was not completed, and it was not 'topical': and on both grounds I could not go to the papers.</p>
         <p>I confirmed sixty adults in the Chapel at 3 p.m. There was a fair congregation, &amp; a very reverent service. Some of the clergy came in afterwards to tea. Drury brought a young doctor to be confirmed. He had been bred an Anabaptist.</p>

         <p>O what a difference is there between the England &amp; the Scotch method of burial! The English does honour to human nature; and even to the poor remains, that were once a temple of the Holy Ghost! But when I see in Scotland a coffin put into the earth, &amp; covered without a word spoken, it reminds me of what was spoken concerning Jehoiakim, "He shall be buried with the burial of an ass!"</p>

         <p>I motored to Waterhouses, &amp; preached at Evensong. The little parish church, a very mean building, could hardly have accommodated more than 300 people. It was full, but not crowded. The Vicar (Rev. C. H. C. K. Kirk) has held office for 17 years. His parish contains more than 5000 people, and he had 150 communicants at Easter. The living is in the gift of the Rector of Brancepeth, &amp; is worth &#x00A3;400 per annum. He is an unmarried man, with a rather supercilious manner, &amp; a parsonic voice. He has the assistance of a Church Army Captain, who officiates in a second church. I was pleased with the attention of the people, but dismayed at the petty scale of the Church in a parish of that size. I returned to Auckland after the service.</p></body></text></TEI>
