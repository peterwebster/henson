         <p>The uniform Christian tradition condemns as of the nature of blasphemy every attempt or desire to bend the Divine will to our own. It conceives of prayer as the costing &amp; difficult uplifting of our wills towards God's. It therefore requires as an indispensable antecedent of all acts of prayer an anxious desire to learn with the highest possible degree of certitude what is the will of God. It enjoins the most confident and fervent prayer for all those things which are beyond all doubt or question according to His Will.</p>

         <p>I devoted another day to the Book, &amp; succeeded in writing a chapter. I have now written around 27,000 words. My limit is 35,000. So I am getting on, but it is poor stuff. In the afternoon I walked with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> in the Park. The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> has an article on Durham Castle in view of tomorrow's meeting.</p>
