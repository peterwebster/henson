         <p>The somewhat widespread idea that psycho&#8211;therapy and psycho&#8211;analysis are synonymous terms is quite erroneous. Psycho&#8211;therapy we employ in the treatment of every case with which we meet, while psycho&#8211;analysis is a term applied to particular methods of psycho&#8211;therapy which are only to be applied in specially selected cases in which other legitimate psychotherapeutic measures have failed to effect a cure.</p>
