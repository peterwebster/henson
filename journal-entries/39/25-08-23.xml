         <p>Alexander<persName xml:id="5214"></persName> brought me a question from M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Underwood's maid â€“ Might she, being a Primitive Methodist, and wont to communicate in her chapel, come to the Holy Communion in mine? Of course I said, Yes, and she came accordingly kneeling alongside M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Berry who is a Presbyterian, and communicates both in her church and in the Church of England. It has ever been held to be one of the duties of the Bishop to decide who shall, and shall not, be admitted to the Holy Communion; and I propose to make my line of exclusion moral, and not doctrinal or denominational. Nothing would induce me to take the responsibility of rejecting from Communion good Christians of whatever description who desire to receive the Holy Sacrament.</p>
         <p>If this attitude were generally adopted by the Bishops, and personally approved by the Church, what would be the effect? Clearly the <hi rend="underline">necessity</hi> of Confirmation would no more be taught, nor the sinfulness of schism, nor the narrow definition of the Church Catholick which would exclude all who are not orthodox in belief. But even so, would not the essentials of Christianity stand out more than ever? The present obligation of good living, &amp; the reigning duty of fraternal charity would be unmistakeably associated with the profession of discipleship by receiving the Lord's Supper.</p>

         <div type="quote">
         <p>The accusers of Christianity do not see how the passions of multitudes are calmed, and the surging waves of wickedness laid to rest, nor do they regard the numbers of those whose savage characters are tamed by means of the Word. And if they find the public benefit to be a fact, they ought to confess their gratitude to the Word for having by a new method delivered men from many vices: &amp; they ought to bear witness to it, that whether it be the truth or not, it has at all events profited mankind.</p>

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Underwood and the P.M.<persName xml:id="4118"></persName> maid came, as well as <hi rend="doubleunderline">Di Darling</hi> but neither her father than <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir H. Craik</hi><persName xml:id="344"></persName> were there. The ladies went to church for mattins: the gentlemen disposed of themselves at home. D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> McCullogh</hi> came to see me, &amp; then I put some touches to the Article, walked in the garden for an hour with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Di Darling</hi>, &amp; so to lunch.</p>
         <p>Then a thunderstorm broke on us, which was, accompanied by rain, which fell with almost tropical violence.</p></body></text></TEI>
