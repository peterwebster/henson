         <p>In connexion with birds' love of colour it is an interesting fact that for five miles round Christ's Hospital, Horsham (the home of the Blue&#8211;coat Boys from London), birds' nests are lined with the fluff and scrap of wool of the boys' yellow stockings!</p>

         <p>I wrote some necessary letters, &amp; then resumed work on the Book, of which I have now written six chapters, containing about 22,000 words. The titles are as follows:&#8211;</p>
         <p>1. Evidence of the New Testament.</p>
         <p>2. The Unction of the Sick.</p>
         <p>3. Exorcism.</p>
         <p>4. Spiritual Healing.</p>
         <p>5. The Faith&#8211;healer.</p>
         <p>6. Lourdes.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName>; and, after tea, took another walk with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Bryan Bourke, the great&#8211;grandson of Archbishop Longley. He is a pleasant&#8211;looking young man who is married, but temporarily separated from his wife by the exigency of his work, which has brought him into this diocese. He is for the time being lodging with a miner at Evenwood.</p></body></text></TEI>
