         <p>I spent the whole day in the Assembly, which was concerned with the re&#8211;casting our system of Patronage. The practical futility of our own discussion oppressed me, for the shortage of clergy is quickly reducing patron's problem to the simple issue, how to find a clergyman not obviously disqualified who will consent to accept nomination to a parish! <hi rend="bold underline">I was impressed by the suspicion and even dislike of the Bishops which found utterance, and never failed to evoke applause</hi>. In the actual experience of the Bishops, there seems no reason for thinking that they are either distrusted or disliked: and certainly lay patrons more commonly than not seek to hand over their patronage to the bishops: <hi rend="bold underline">but bishops in the gross are apparently very unpopular</hi>! I made two short speeches in the course of the day neither of which was particularly well received! I dined in Park Lane alone with mine host. We talked together on many subjects, and I was again impressed by his good judgement, fine temper and range of interest. A certain diffidence and modesty have vetoed a considerable career.</p></body></text></TEI>
