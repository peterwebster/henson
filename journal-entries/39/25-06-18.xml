         <div type="quote">
         <p><hi rend="italic">No. I think Asquith ought to be elected as clearly the best man. If unopposed his election carries no other suggestion than that a large view of academic duty and dignity. A contest must introduce the properly irrelevant issue of party politics.</hi></p>
         </div>
         <p><hi rend="italic">This is sure to get round to Lord Cave, &amp; may make him angry! But I could not tie myself on to the coat&#8211;tails of one of the foolishest partisans I have ever chanced to know. For such I judge Oman to be, though, apart from politics, he is one of the best fellows in the world. Moreover, even if I did think Cave preferable to Asquith as Chancellor of Oxford, I should not think it decent to emphasize the fact by joining in Cave's nomination. For Asquith, showed a certain kindness to me, and offered me the Deanery of Durham. I do not desire to push this consideration too far, but there is a fitness in things, and I could not think it decent to go out of my way to oppose a man who had done me much kindness in the past.</hi></p>

         <p>I wrote letters, and then worked at the Halifax sermon. After lunch I walked round the Park. <hi rend="bold underline">Then Jimmie<persName xml:id="3572"></persName> came to see me about his new outlook</hi>. The financial situation at home is, of course, the core of the problem. How few people realize that the Pauline dictum is more often than not reversed. <hi rend="bold underline">It is the children who must maintain their parents, not the other way round</hi>. This circumstance makes the financing of Ordination candidates so difficult. We not only have to find money for the candidate, but have to re&#8211;imburse his parents for the loss of his contribution to the family budget.</p>

         <p>M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Westcott, Brooke's<persName xml:id="5385"></persName> father, sends a defective copy of Bishop Morton's<persName xml:id="4636"></persName> polemic against the Mass to be added to the other books by Bishops of Durham which the Castle possesses. The volume belonged to Bishop Westcott<persName xml:id="1047"></persName>. There is, indeed, a wide gulf between, the 'conversations' at Malines &amp; Morton's full&#8211;blooded denunciation of the Mass, as "a very Mass, or rather a Gulf of many Superstitions, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Positions and Practices"!</p></body></text></TEI>
