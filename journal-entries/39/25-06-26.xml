         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8.15 a.m. All the Rural Deans and both Archdeacons communicated. After breakfast we resumed Conference in the Library, and discussed a series of practical questions including the raising of funds for Escombe. Then an early lunch, and the company dispersed. On the whole the meeting seemed to be successful, &amp; certainly there was an excellent spirit. But the problem of diocesan administration is seen to be more formidable, the more closely it is studied. <hi rend="bold underline">Jimmie<persName xml:id="3572"></persName> came to see me during the afternoon and we talked over his plans.</hi> On the whole I think he had better read for Ordination at Advent, but he seems rather to shrink from so speedy a crossing of the Rubicon which divides the layman from the cleric. He may be right. The decision is complicated by the question of finance. If he were alone to be considered, the matter, though formidable would not be so baffling: but there are his mother and sister to be reckoned with. As a deacon he would be capable of earning money, &amp; so far contributing to their maintenance. I motored to Durham, &amp; dined at the County Club with the High Sheriff (Stobart). I came away about 9.45 p.m., &amp; returned to Auckland.</p></body></text></TEI>
