         <p>"I preached at night in the market place at Wigton. The congregation, when I began, consisted of one woman, two boys, &amp; three or four little girls: but in a quarter of an hour we had most of the town. I was a good deal moved at the exquisite self&#8211;sufficiency which was visible in the countenance, air, and whole deportment of a considerable part of them. This constrained me to use a very uncommon plainness of speech. They bore it well. Who knows but some may profit?</p>

There we lunched with old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ritson<persName xml:id="3822"></persName>, and then proceeded to the little church where I instituted the Rev. Percy de l'Argent Bell, to the perpetual curacy of the parish. I returned to Auckland after the service.</p></body></text></TEI>
