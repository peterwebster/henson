         <p>O God of all mercy, and Source of all Strength, Whom to know is life eternal, look with compassion on me at this time, and grant me the guidance of Thy Holy Spirit in the difficult path I must tread. Show Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my heart unto Thee. Regard not my sins but the needs of Thy People, and suffer me not to go contrary to Thy Will, I entreat Thee. Thou knowest the greatness of my transgression, and the sorrow of my heart. From my mother's womb, Thou hast led me forward in ways unexpected, &amp; brought me to this hour. Leave me not comfortless, O Father of Mercies, but grant me the Comfort of Thy Presence in all the perils &amp; sadness of my course, for Jesus Christ's sake, They Blessed Son, my Lord &amp; Saviour.</p>
         <p>Amen</p>

         <p>I slept ill last night; perhaps it was the unusual mental excitement of so much talking, perhaps the warmth of the weather. I know not, but I marked the hours, &amp; revolved in my mind my many &amp; waxing cares. I enter the day with the feeling of fatigue which might match its close.</p>

         <p>After breakfast I took leave of the Master &amp; his wife and drove to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>. After reading the papers, I went to the hair&#8211;dresser's and had my hair cut. Then I visited Rees's book shop and ordered "John Inglesant" as a birthday present for Jimmie<persName xml:id="3572"></persName>. Then I walked to Westminster, &amp; called on <hi rend="doubleunderline">Storr</hi><persName xml:id="1899"></persName>, but, finding him absent, I drove to the Zoo, and saw the new "Monkey Hill", and Aquarium, both real additions to the wonderful collection. But the place was crawling with school boys! I lunched at the Athenaeum, and then went to the House of Lords. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Banbury</hi> raised the question of public economy. A debate developed<hi rend="doubleunderline">. Lord Joicey </hi>spoke feelingly from the coal&#8211;owner's point of view. Sitting beside me was a young peer of an attractive aspect, with whom I became friendly. He told me that he was <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Gage</hi>, &amp; that he hailed from Sussex. <hi rend="italic bold underline">I made a short impromptu speech which did me no credit. However it was mercifully treated</hi>. Then I went to Garland's Hotel, and dressed for dinner. I dined with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Darling</hi><persName xml:id="4032"></persName> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Diana</hi>. The only other guest was <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Jersey</hi>, who gave me a lift in her car back to my hotel. <hi rend="bold underline">I was much struck by the portrait by Charles Furse of L</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Darling as a comparatively young man. He must have been quite fascinating</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
