         <p>The Rev. J. J. James, moderator of the North West Province of the Congressional Union, said yesterday at the Union's autumnal assembly held in Bournemouth that while in 1903 there were 1813 fully qualified &amp; recognised ministers in charge of Congressional Churches, the number had fallen in 1923 to 1559. The number of churches wanting ministers in 1903 was 224, and in 1923 it was 374. There had been a decrease of churches from 3567 to 3511 in the same period. An examination of Church members again revealed a serious decline. The number of men entering the college was not sufficient to provide for their churches if they were to be properly equipped. There was one improvement, however, this year (v. The Times. Oct 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, 1925.) It is then, evident, that the "slump in organized religion" which is so painfully apparent in the case of the Church of England is not imperceptible in the case of "Free" churches. If allowance be made for the increase in population, the facts are still more disconcerting, but the full measure of their gravity is not taken until it is realized that the decline in quality is even more marked than the decline in numbers. If, as certainly does not appear unlikely, the "slump" continues for another 20 years, what will be the state of Religion in Great Britain?</p>

         <p>After Lunch <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie</hi><persName xml:id="3572"></persName> accompanied me to Darlington where I presided at the annual meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. There was a scanty attendance of about 40 females, &amp; perhaps, half a dozen males. The Mayor having referred unfavourably to 'flag&#8211;days'. I took occasion to emphasize the case against, &amp; expressed my hope that they would be definitely disallowed. This perturbed the officials of the society not a little. The 'deputation' from the parent society â€“ an odd&#8211;looking little ma with a mighty flow of words and a palsied arm, was particularly excited. We returned to Auckland in time for tea. I received a consignment of bound copies of Bishop Lightfoot's<persName xml:id="1817"></persName> Ordination Addresses for presentation to the clergy at this Ordination. Also, I received a specially prepared book which the Oxford Press has printed in order to assist the Bishops in their treatment of P.B. Revision. The 'Daily Express' telegraphed a request that I should send them an article of 1500 words of 'Spiritualism', &amp; offering a fee f 25 guineas. I want the money, but I dislike the subject: so I wired back "Regret. Quite impossible". Money would seem to be quickly made in journalism. </p></body></text></TEI>
