         <p>One of the chief conclusions to which modern psychology is leading is that human behaviours is much less influenced by ideas than was formally supposed, but responds rather to appeals made in the symbolic manner by which the subconscious or unconscious levels of the mind seem to be so greatly influenced. This kind of mechanism seems to leave but little scope for the motive power which have hitherto been universally ascribed to the great ideas of the world's history, to such ideas as underlay, or seem to have underlain, the Reformation and the rebellion against the autocracy of the Stuarts……. It suggests that while ideas are really active there is something more behind them than an appeal to intelligence, &amp; that they owe much of their efficacy to the power of personality, possibly to the instinctive desire of the human group to have a leader to whom it can look for guidance in the same unwitting manner with which the members of a herd of animals regard their leader.</p>

         <p><hi rend="bold underline">"Instincts v. Ideas" might not be a bad subject for a short gibing article against "democracy".</hi> It means that the 'demagogue' who voices the inbred prejudices or desires of the multitude is the rival, enemy, and oppressor of the thinker. It is a rivalry conspicuously exhibited in the historic conflict between Luther and Erasmus. Can we justify the contention that the triumphs of instinct are immediate and temporary, while those of ideas are distant and permanent? "<hi rend="underline">The things that are seen are temporary: the things that are not seen are eternal".</hi> Certainly Luther is more obsolete than Erasmus; but then, Luther's obsoleteness does but reflect the general decay of religion. What use has a secularist age for <hi rend="underline">justification by faith only</hi>? The triumph of Erasmus means no more than that the modern world finds his intellectualism more congruous with itself than Luther's fervent dogmatism. The ideas which prevail are those which accord with the instincts (i.e. the interests &amp; appetites) of the majority. Hence the significant combination of religious movements and social or economic changes. The Reformation, with its doctrine of private judgement &amp; and its revolt against the yoke of ecclesiastical system, fell in easily with the demand for self–expression which the middle–classes were making &amp; provided a sacred "slogan" for the revolt against feudalism in church &amp; state. </p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Danesfort</hi><persName xml:id="2092"></persName> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Prothero</hi> went off after breakfast, talking eagerly up to the last! Then <hi rend="doubleunderline">Darling</hi> &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Craik</hi><persName xml:id="344"></persName> went off to see South Church with the Vicar, and I betook myself to my study. Then I was visited by the Vicar, who wanted from me a variety of things: &amp; then the Rev. Roland Ker, the curate of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Pauls, Hendon, came to explain the reason he was leaving diocese. He has been married 9 years, and has 7 children! He hopes to add to his income by teaching in Blackburn. I questioned him about the state of things in Hendon, which is the oldest part of Sunderland. He said that two thirds of the parishioners lived in tenement houses which are grossly overcrowded: that the morals of the people were plainly deteriorating since the war: &amp; that most of them lived on the "dole", &amp; were content to do so. All this is familiar enough, but none the less woeful hearing. He stayed to lunch. In the afternoon we all motored to Finchale Priory, stopping to see Brancepeth church of the way. The excellent man in charge of the ruins showed us round, and explained what the Board of Works had done. They certainly have justified this trusteeship. We had tea at the farm, and then returned to Auckland. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> returned from Scotland, &amp; went through such letter as had accumulated. </p></body></text></TEI>
