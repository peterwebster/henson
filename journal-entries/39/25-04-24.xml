         <p>The question of bodily healing, whether spiritual or medicinal, seems to be that upon which the primitive Church is least fitted to be our guide. Natural science was scarcely known to the Christians of that period, &amp; to go to them for direction in the disputable territory where science and the supernatural meet is to run the risk of obscurantism. We cannot think ourselves back into the world in which they moved, for those ages of history are closed &amp; separated from us by a gulf of time, &amp; to sweep away God's teaching of centuries is not an act of faith, but a gesture of reaction.</p>

         <p>I decided to go to town &amp; thus 'kill three birds' with one stone â€“ attend the H. of Lords, go to Q.A.B., &amp; make my d&#x00E9;but at Grillions! I telegraphed for a room to Garlands, &amp; wrote to cancel my engagement to speak for the League of Nations at Sunderland. Then I settled down to the Book &amp; wrote about 2000 words. After lunch I went in to Durham, &amp; presided at a meeting of the Religious Education Board.
