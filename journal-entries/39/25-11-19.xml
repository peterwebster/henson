         <p><hi rend="bold">Thursday, November 19</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1925.</hi></p>
         <p>I spent the day in the Assembly, where a number of measures were generally approved including one for <hi rend="bold underline">settling episcopal pensions</hi>. I wish they would leave things alone! <hi rend="doubleunderline">Car&#x00F6;e</hi><persName xml:id="648"></persName> sent in a note desiring to see me: so I ran to his flat, and had a short talk. Then I had tea with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Storr</hi><persName xml:id="1899"></persName>, with whom I discussed the Report of the Commission on Ecclesiastical Courts. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Guy Rogers</hi> came in, and I consulted him also. Both of these "liberal evangelicals" expressed alarm at the scheme for the Final Court.</p>
         <p>My article on "<hi rend="underline">Science and Religion</hi>" appeared in the <hi rend="underline">Evening </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Standard</hi>. It reads mildly enough: but, indeed, what can one say? The Bishop of Chester (<hi rend="doubleunderline">Luke Paget</hi>) said that on a second reading of my '<hi rend="underline">Notes</hi>', he liked the book very much. The Bishop of Southwark (<hi rend="doubleunderline">Garbett</hi>) said that he agreed with it, but not without reserves. Alarmist accounts of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Queen Alexandra's</hi> health were in the evening papers. Her Majesty's 81<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> birthday is to be celebrated next week.</p></body></text></TEI>
