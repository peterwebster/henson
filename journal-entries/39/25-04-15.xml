         <p>They are not skilful considerers of human things who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sinâ€¦ Though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye cannot bereave him of his covetousness. Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised in any hermitage ye cannot make them chaste that came not hither so.</p>

It certainly is a most amazing invention, &amp; carries great possibilities.</p>
