         <p>It is not as a rule wise to offer physical violence to 'blacklegs'; but there is nothing wrong about it, except in the eyes of the law and the middle&#8211;class. The only argument against it, and also against militancy of other sorts, is that they do not pay.</p>

         <p><hi rend="bold underline">This is a characteristic sentence from Cole's writing, &amp; gives the measure of his competence as a moralist. This moral issue, which is raised by the latest development of "Labour" deserves far more attention than it has hitherto received. Trade union congresses generally include in their programme a sermon, &amp; there is always found some well&#8211;known dignitary ready to preach it: but these sermons never touch on the gross conflict between the new morality of the "Class&#8211;War", &amp; the Gospel of Christ. There is "sob&#8211;stuff" in abundance, but the moral witness is to seek.</hi></p>
