         <div type="quote">
         <p>God, who, as at this time didst teach the hearts of thy faithful people, by the sending to them the light of the Holy Spirit: Grant us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to rejoice in his holy comfort; though the merits of Christ Jesus or Saviour, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the same Spirit, of God, world without end. Amen</p>

         <p>Ignorance, prejudice, self&#8211;seeking, weakness â€“ these are the four cardinal foes of that "right judgement in all things", for which on Whitsunday we are bidden to pray. The Holy Spirit is "the Spirit of Truth", the Spirit of Holiness "," the Spirit of Jesus", and "the Comforter". Thus He meets our need at every point. Of all men surely the Bishop has greatest reason to adopt the prayer of Whitsunday, for he is so placed that upon his judgement much must needs turn. His choice of men in Ordination and in the exercise of Patronage 'makes or mars' the whole life of the Church in his diocese. His personal habit, even his chance words, assist or hinder his ministry. He is the representative of the diocese in the outer world, &amp; its reputation is ultimately his. Who is sufficient?</p>

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 10 communicants, including Car&#x00F6;e<persName xml:id="648"></persName> and Ashton. After breakfast we motored to Stockton, picking up Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> at Sedgefield on the way. I dedicated the Kirk Memorial Chapel annexed to the parish church, &amp; afterwards lunched with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Kirk at Norton. I took the opportunity of speaking about Escombe, &amp; the old man promised &#x00A3;10. Then we motored to Durham, where I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; pronounced the Benediction from the Throne. After tea with the Dawson&#8211;Walkers<persName xml:id="3161"></persName>, I motored to Sunderland, and preached at the Seamen's Church which was celebrating its anniversary, &amp; commemorating the Battle of Juthland. The Missioner seems to be enterprising &amp; popular. I was pleased with this service, to which (as I was informed) none but sea&#8211;faring men &amp; their wives were admitted. Clayton preached &amp; celebrated at S. Gabriel's. I picked him up after service. At Durham we recovered Car&#x00F6;e, who had not gone with us to Sunderland. We were all back in Auckland by 9.30 p.m. The weather throughout was tricky. Showers of rain alternated with bursts of sunshine. There was a very cold wind. On the whole the day tended to improve, and night fell on a fair promise of tomorrow.</p></body></text></TEI>
