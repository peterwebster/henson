         <p>I worked all the morning at the Glasgow Sermon. After lunch I motored to Chopwell, &amp; confirmed 78 persons, &amp;, then, immediately consecrated an addition to the churchyard. The Vicar – Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Angus Macdonald – is the first incumbent of the parish, &amp; has held office for 8 years. He seemed hopeful &amp; contented. After tea at the Vicarage, I went on to S. Paul's, Gateshead, &amp; there confirmed 117 persons. Canon Stack sets great store by his custom of having every candidate accompanied by a witness. The idea is good, but the delay in confirming is trying. Newsom joined me, &amp; came back to the Castle, where he was due for the Women's Quiet Day.</p></body></text></TEI>
