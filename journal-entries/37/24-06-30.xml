         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The reunion of clergy whom I have myself ordained in this diocese was carried through without mishap</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I celebrated the Holy Communion at 11.30 a.m. and, so far as I could see, everybody communicated. Lunch followed, &amp; was a cheerful meal: then we spent the afternoon in the garden, playing games &amp;c, until tea, after which there was Evensong in the chapel, &amp; I said a few words to the men: after this they went their way. Sykes<persName xml:id="3470"></persName> was the only "official"; &amp; to him I confided the dolorous business of John.<persName xml:id="5355"></persName></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Brereton</hi> from the Barnard Castle School arrived in hot haste about 6 p.m. to consult me about a situation which had developed. That unpleasant fellow, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bircham</hi><persName xml:id="5380"></persName>, and his Papist ally <hi rend="doubleunderline">Wiseman</hi> are making mischief over the appointment of a chaplain. I fear that they have the letter of the scheme on their side.</p>
         <p>Then I motored to Durham, and dined with J. G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> to meet the High Sheriff. The company consisted of Sir Hedworth Williamson, Capt<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> Appleby, Judge Greenwall, the Governor of the Prison, Sir Frank Brown, his son, myself, &amp; Wilson. It was a pleasant party enough, but all belonging to that older world, which is passing. I returned to Auckland about 10.15 p.m. <hi rend="bold underline">For the last time my William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> motored me over the familiar road we have traversed together so many times. Tomorrow ends our fellowship</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
