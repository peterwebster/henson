         <p>I received a curiously interesting letter from an American correspondent. G. Gifo Everett, 204 Park Ave, Norfolk, Va. U.S.A. He states that he himself has been "a strong temperance advocate" all his life, and is therefore unaffected by Prohibition, to which he is utterly opposed for reasons which are both strong, and strongly stated. </p>
         <p>After lunch we i.e. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, Boden<persName xml:id="2936"></persName>, and I, motored 20 miles to visit Bishop Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> and his wife in their cottage. The weather was brilliant, the country looked its best, &amp; the air of the Yorkshire moor was vigorous. We had tea, &amp; returned to Auckland via Barnard Castle, 26 miles.</p>
         <p>Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> went off on his holiday. He was busy up to the very hour of his departure.</p></body></text></TEI>
