         <p><hi rend="italic">O Lord, from whom all good things do come; Grant to us thy humble servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen</hi></p>

         <p>This is an excellent prayer for the perplexed, and, therefore, for me surely the most perplexed of all men. I can't see my way in any direction, &amp; the fog deepens. "<hi rend="underline">Show Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my soul unto Thee".</hi> The Gospel is a message of comfort to the perplexed: "<hi rend="underline">These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world".</hi></p>

         <p>At 12.15 noon I left the Castle, and motored to Gateshead, where I lunched at the Rectory. Then amid thunder&#8211;claps &amp; descending rain I set out with the Rector &amp; Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> to take part in an "Empire Service" of Boy&#8211;scouts. We perforce had the service in a cinema hall as the rain fell with violence. Later I preached in Holy Trinity church to a congregation mainly composed of young women! The Vicar, McKitterick, is a good man, but of a consumptive type. After service I returned to the Castle.</p></body></text></TEI>
