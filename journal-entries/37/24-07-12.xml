         <p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, July 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1924.</hi></p>
         <p>I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and (excessive heat making movement laborious and imprudent) continued there all day. I wrote many letters <hi rend="underline">including one to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Nimmins</hi><persName xml:id="3571"></persName>.</p>
         <p>I received a letter from Worsey, the Vicar of Bodenham, in my old diocese, which, in view of the genuine goodness of the writer, has a significance not to be lightly regarded. It runs thus:&#8211;</p>
         <div type="letter">
         <p>Dear Lord Bishop,</p>
         <p>As one whose privilege it once was to serve under you, <hi rend="bold underline">may I thank you for your great speech in the Upper House on Tuesday</hi>.<note xml:id="546" n="1"></note> In my own little world (little but very complete in its way) it is this obviously one&#8211;sided, class legislation, which offends the mass of our people, &amp; alienates them from the Church.</p>
         <p>Your outspoken utterance gives new courage to some of us, who refuse to 'toe' the conventional, official 'line', presumably from slackness or apathy, but really from a sincere desire to follow the right.</p>
         <p>Feeling these matters as I do, I hasten to say that a few more utterances such as yours w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> give men new confidence in the Church as God's Society, and 'draw them in' as the uplifted Christ is pledged to 'draw <hi rend="bold">[112] </hi>them in'.</p>
         <p>Believe me, Yours gratefully</p>
         <p>Fred. W. Worsey.</p>
         </div>
         <p>This is an unusual kind of letter, and seemed to me deserving both of acknowledgement to the author, and of insertion in this journal.</p>
         <p>The well&#8211;known bookseller &amp; publisher, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Henry Cecil Sotheran</hi>, also wrote approvingly. He begins his letter thus:&#8211;</p>
         <div type="quote">
         <p>"As one who (if you will believe that no disrespect is meant) is sometimes puzzled at the apparent working of your mind, I w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> most respectfully &amp; warmly thank you for the courage of your speech in the House of Lords".</p>
         </div>
         <p>I suppose he is an "Anglo&#8211;Catholick", or, possibly, a member of the 'Life and Liberty' set.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Adam Smith</hi><persName xml:id="244"></persName> was in the Club. He said that the Government had sent to him all the testimonials &amp;c of the candidates for the Chair of Ecclesiastical History in Aberdeen. <hi rend="bold underline">One of the candidates urged as one reason for his appointment that he was the son of a carpenter!</hi></p>
         <p>The heat grew ever more intense as the day wore on, &amp; my walk from the Club to Park Lane was really exhausting.</p></body></text></TEI>
