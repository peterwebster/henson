         <p>I motored to Sunderland, and lunched at the Grant Hotel with a society of business men called 'Rotarians' – <hi rend="bold underline">rather a laughable farce really but taken with enormous gravity by the members – and there I made a rash, possibly a wicked, speech on Prohibition, which was not, I think, what they either desired or expected</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> Then I went off to Tanfield, and took part in the funeral of old Canon Archdale. It was a decent, solemn function. I returned to Sunderland, &amp; after tea with the Rector, had an interview with an Ordination candidate; received a deputation about parochial quotas; &amp; met the Committee for Church extension at Cleadon. Then we went back to Auckland.</p></body></text></TEI>
