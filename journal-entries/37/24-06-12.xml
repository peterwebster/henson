         <p>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> arrived with the car at 9 a.m., &amp; motored me back to Auckland, where Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> awaited me with a mountain of accumulated correspondence. I spent most of the day in writing letters. Wynne Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName> arrived at teaâ€“time, and talked with me about the woeful John,<persName xml:id="5355"></persName> who had been making him the recipient of his woes. Then the Ordination candidates, &amp; Watson<persName xml:id="5392"></persName> came. At 7 p.m. Evensong was read, and the first address given. Watson has a pleasant voice, and a good manner.</p></body></text></TEI>
