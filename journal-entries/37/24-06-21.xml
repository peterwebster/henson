         <p>I wrote a short "Presidential Address" for the Diocesan Conference, making some personal references to the dead &amp; resigned clergy, cracking up my new suffragan, &amp; calling attention to the Report of the Eccles<hi rend="superscript underline">l</hi> Property Commission. Then I came away in the motor to go to Glasgow for the Sunday School Convention. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> went with me as far as Durham, where he was charged with looking after the Lay Workers' Festival, &amp; I went on to Newcastle. The station was horribly crowded on account of the local races. However one of the railway officials recognised me, &amp; showed much deferential kindness. He refused a tip, &amp; I felt humbled at having proffered it. <hi rend="bold underline">The train arrived in Glasgow 3/4 hour after the scheduled time</hi>, with the result that I arrived at mine host's house woefully late for dinner. He had got together a company to meet me. There was Sir Robert Bruce,<persName xml:id="4933"></persName> the Editor of the Glasgow Herald, who reminded me of our former meeting at Fairlie: a certain Colonel Reid, who hailed from Ireland: an American Professor, who reminded me of the Yale Lectures on Preaching, which I gave in Newhaven in 1909, &amp; which he had heard: a facetious &amp; talkative minister, who, I gather, is in charge of the Cathedral here: &amp; several others. We talked with animation &amp; good humour, but nothing of the conversation held a place in my mind, and the record is empty! Why is it that the most interesting dinners are in the retrospect often the most barren? <hi rend="bold underline">Are dinners, like nations, happiest when they have no annals</hi><hi rend="bold">?</hi> Shortly after 11 p.m. I went off to bed.</p></body></text></TEI>
