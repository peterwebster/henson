         <p>We received the Holy Communion in the Chapel of the Palace. This is a beautiful little building of the 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century, and contains a lovely frescoe of c. A.D. 1260. The Madonna with the Divine Child in her arms, adored by incense&#8211;swinging cherubs, is depicted with rare dignity, purity, &amp; sweetness. The Palace itself is extensive &amp; interesting, greatly re&#8211;modelled in the 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century, but still retaining many older features. The garden is very ample &amp; beautiful. From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. we – <hi rend="doubleunderline">Burrows</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Frere</hi><persName xml:id="2021"></persName>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi><persName xml:id="552"></persName>, &amp; I – were engaged in going through the 39 articles. We resumed work at 5 p.m., &amp; went on to 8 p.m.: and, by postponing the anti&#8211;papal articles, &amp; the series which deal with the Calvinistic controversies, we got through the whole formulary.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Burrows</hi> shewed us the Cathedral in the interval between lunch and Evensong. It is a finer building than I had expected to see. An unusual feature is the double aisles of the nave. A window set up by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cardinal Manning</hi> to the memory of his wife suggests many reflexions. <hi rend="italic">Had the lady lived longer, the history of two churches might have been different.</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">There are no less than 7 altars set up in the church.</hi><hi rend="italic">What doctrine of the Sacrament can justify this multiplication of altars?
