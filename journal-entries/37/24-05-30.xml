         <p>I cleared up as many things as possible before going to Ireland. Also I celebrated the Holy Communion in Carissima's<persName xml:id="76"></persName> room. Then William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> motored <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and me to Darlington, where we took train to Liverpool â€“ a tiresome journey. We dined in the Railway Hotel, &amp; there I was accosted by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Albert Mason</hi> and his wife. <hi rend="underline">He is now Town&#8211;clerk of Barnsley</hi>. After dinner we went to the Nelson dock &amp; got on board the Ardmore. It started half an hour after time. The sea was like a mill&#8211;pond, so we turned in with comparatively easy minds for our journey to Dublin.</p></body></text></TEI>
