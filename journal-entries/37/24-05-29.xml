         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. After breakfast I prepared an address for the Dublin clergy. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> accompanied me into Durham for Evensong in the Cathedral. After the service I mounted the Tower with the choir to hear the 3 anthems sung in memory of Neville's Cross. Then I went to see M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Quirk, &amp; after tea with her, had an interview with Herbert to whom I practically offered the curacy at Easington. Then I returned to Auckland, &amp; found Jimmie<persName xml:id="3572"></persName> awaiting me. He is likely to be at a loss for employment owing to the cutting down of staff on the amalgamated railways.</p></body></text></TEI>
