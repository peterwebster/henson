         <p>We (<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> &amp; I) left the Castle at 7.30 a.m., and motored to South Shields via Sunderland (32 miles) where we arrived at 8.45 a.m. The parish church was crowded with a congregation, whose reverent demeanour and general responding showed that it was composed of regular church&#8211;goers. I celebrated the marriage of the Vicar, Hudson Barker<persName xml:id="3575"></persName>, and Winifred Bowes, &amp; then, after giving an address, celebrated the Holy Communion. The whole congregation remained to the close of the service, the communicants numbering about 20, comprised of the newly&#8211;married persons and their relatives. Then we attended the wedding&#8211;breakfast, at which I made a short speech. Then we returned to the Castle, dropping Ella in Durham, as she had to attend a meeting there.</p>
         <p>Among my letters, I found a copy of "The Anglican Church Magazine, September, 1924, The Official Magazine and Directory of the Diocese of North &amp; Central Europe".</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I dealt with the morning's correspondence. I suggested to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Little</hi> that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dobson</hi> should go to him as curate: and offered Christ Church, W. Hartlepool, to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Barry</hi>, late of Knutsford. <hi rend="italic">Also, I wrote to the Bishop of London calling his attention to what purports to be h</hi><hi rend="italic underline">i</hi><hi rend="italic">s "Official Magazine", and yet contains an 'Editorial' in which the Bishop of Durham is referred to with intolerable rudeness. It is hardly decent that the venom of 'Anglo&#8211;Catholicism' should find expression in 'official' papers.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
