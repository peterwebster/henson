         <p>I left the Admiralty House after breakfast, and drove to King's Cross, dropping <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> on the way at the British Museum. I left at 10 a.m. and reached Darlington at 2.50 p.m., where William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> met me with the car. He told me that the fatal letter had come from Johannesburg, and that he was invited to go thither. So I must make up my mind to part with him.</p>
         <p>Chancellor P. V. Smith<persName xml:id="765"></persName> arrived about 5 p.m. His natural dullness is so powerfully re&#8211;inforced by his deafness that it is almost impossible to carry on conversation with him. The obvious requirements of a decent hospitality compelled me, none the less, to essay the well&#8211;nigh hopeless task, and by the time I showed the old gentleman to his bedroom, I was physically exhausted! It was as if I had been practising for open&#8211;air addresses for two hours on end!</p>

         <p>This is certainly true, and yet I do not think I am mistaken when I say of the most energetic religious movements in the country that the [sic] are supported, almost confessedly, 'on a foundation of historical disguise'. The 'Anglo&#8211;Catholics' almost exult in outraging History.</p></body></text></TEI>
