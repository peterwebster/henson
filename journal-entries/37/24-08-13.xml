         <p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, August 13</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1924.</hi></p>
         <p>A wet morning, but soon improving, though clouded and threatening all day long. I wrote my letters, and read through the "Copec" Report on 'Christianity and War' – a very pacifist production.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Bainton, the purblind parson, came to lunch. I counselled him to seek work in another diocese, as my brutal prejudice against blind parsons was insurmountable</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> He seems intelligent and well–informed, but his infirmity is but too apparent. After lunch, Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> and I walked round the Park. On my return to the House I wrote several letters. I offered the living of Westgate in Weardale which Greenway is vacating, to Perry<persName xml:id="5389"></persName>, the Rector of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> James', Gateshead, but, as the endowment is about £50 less than that which he at present enjoys, I doubt whether he will accept my offer. The shortage of clergy is brought home uncomfortably at this holiday season, when arrangements have to be made for the absence of the incumbents. In the old days these were easily made with neighbours, but now strangers must be hired, &amp; the available hirelings are often enough disreputable. Pember<persName xml:id="66"></persName> writes to inquire about <hi rend="underline">Collier</hi>, the curate of S. Margt's Durham, who was formerly a Bible–clerk of All Souls. There is a college living vacant, which Collier might fill. I wrote in terms of favourable recommendation, but I shall be sorry to lose him from the diocese.</p>

I hope you will consider my application, &amp; give me a chance as a vacancy occurs. Enclosed please find references.</p>
