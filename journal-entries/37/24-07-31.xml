         <p>I returned to Darlington, where I was met by Leng with the car. Lady Constance Butler<persName xml:id="5398"></persName> &amp; Mercy Webbe came to lunch, &amp; stayed the night. The former is 'marooned' by a break&#8211;down of her motor: the latter is <hi rend="underline">en route</hi> for Norway. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> entertained a party of Knutsford quondams. Sykes from Middlesborough, and Bishop Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> came to join in it, &amp; both stayed the night. <hi rend="bold underline">Meanwhile the electricians are installing the electric light, and, as a consequence of their activities, filling the Castle with dust, &amp; making the rooms impassable with uprooted boards</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
