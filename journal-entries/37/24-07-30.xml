         <p>I travelled as comfortably as possible in a 'sleeper', and was called by the attendant at 7 a.m.in the station at King's Cross. After breakfasting in the Railway Hotel I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; left my bags. I walked to Victoria, &amp; took train to Birchington. There I was met by Arthur<persName xml:id="3128"></persName>, &amp; lunched with him at the Bungalow Hotel. Arthur Rawle<persName xml:id="813"></persName> &amp; Bertie also attended. We four were the mourners. The service was reverent &amp; consoling. After tea, we returned to London, except my brother who remained to wind up everything. I travelled to York, and put up at the Railway Hotel for the night.</p></body></text></TEI>
