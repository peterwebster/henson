         <p>Still that intolerable charge! In the afternoon I walked round the Park with the dogs; and on my return was vaccinated by old D<hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi>Wardle. There has been a scare of smallpox in the town, and we are all the victims.</p>
         <p>I think it might be worthwhile for me to work into my charge a fairly full discussion of the Temperance Question. It would not be necessary to read it at the Visitation, &amp; it might be prudent to reserve what I write for the published form of the Charge. And the same course might, perhaps, be followed with some other thorny subjects.</p></body></text></TEI>
