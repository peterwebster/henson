         <p><hi rend="bold">Easter Monday, April 21</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1924.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Webbe</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Penelope</hi><persName xml:id="2937"></persName> went away after breakfast, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kathleen</hi><persName xml:id="2658"></persName> soon followed their example. The morning was filled with the mingled employments of preparing for our own departure. At 2.30 p.m. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I left the Castle in the small motor open, thought the sky was overcast. As we went out of the gates, the people, largely children &amp; youths, were streaming into the Park, which stands open on Easter Monday to unhindered admission.</p>
         <p>We motored without incident to Ripon via. Piercebridge, and there called on the Dean, whom we found attendant on a sick wife. We then made our way to Sorley Hall, where we had tea with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir John and Lady Barron</hi>. She was rather "full of" the ecclesiastical storm in the Protestant Episcopal Church of U.S.A., in which her father, <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Parkes</hi>, is a central figure. She said that he was induced to preach the sermon which has so greatly moved <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Manning</hi> by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Lawrence</hi>. This, if indeed it be the case, is interesting. We continued our journey to <hi rend="underline">Sandbeck</hi>, but did not arrive before 9 p.m. being greatly delayed by the congestion in the street of Wetherby, where races had been proceeding, &amp; by the difficulty of finding our route after leaving Doncaster. However we did finally arrive, &amp; were welcomed by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord<persName xml:id="3465"></persName> &amp; Lady Scarbrough<persName xml:id="3466"></persName></hi> with whom were two guests, one a Christ Church Science don.</p></body></text></TEI>
