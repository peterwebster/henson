         <p>I worked at this precious Charge, which grows more disgusting to me daily. In the afternoon I went to Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, and left him the mortgage on the Bishoprick (&#x00A3;800) for signature &amp; sealing. He told me that he was originally designed for Holy Orders, and actually presented himself to Bishop Harvey Goodwin as an Ordination candidate. The Bishop was prepared to ordain him on the title of a private tutorship. But he did not feel that he was suitably disposed for the Ministry, &amp; first postponed his ordination, and then abandoned his purpose.</p>
         <p>On my return to the Castle I resumed work on the Charge. </p></body></text></TEI>
