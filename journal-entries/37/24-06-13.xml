         <p>I celebrated the Holy Comm<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> at 8.15 a.m., and then, after breakfast, set to work on the "Charge" for the Ordinandi. Then after lunch I went into Durham &amp; presided at a meeting of the Religious Education Board. After this, I had an interview with Haslewood of Pelton. Then I returned to Auckland, and had interviews with the candidates. They seem a sincere set of men, not well educated or particularly intelligent, but resolutely determined to do their duty. After dinner I had some talk with Moulsdale<persName xml:id="3159"></persName> about the discipline cases, which are now troubling me.</p>
         <p>Watson's addresses to the candidates have been extremely good in tone, manner, &amp; substance. I think it might be well to offer him the Rectory of Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring.</p></body></text></TEI>
