         <p>At 11 a.m. I confirmed M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ferguson, the doctor's wife, in the Chapel. After lunch Boden<persName xml:id="2936"></persName> and I motored to Whitburn, &amp; visited the C.L.B.<orgName xml:id="45"></orgName> camp. I had tea with Colonel Boden, and spoke to the boys. Then I called on Bailey<persName xml:id="2806"></persName>, and discussed with him the case of woeful John: also I called on Wynne&#8211;Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName>. Then we returned to Auckland.</p></body></text></TEI>
