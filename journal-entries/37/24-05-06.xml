         <p>Cruikshank and I left the Castle at 9.30 a.m., and motored via Barnard Castle and Kendal to Colton, where <hi rend="bold underline">the funeral of Bishop Quirk</hi><persName xml:id="2785"></persName> had been arranged. The church is well set up on high ground, &amp; is surrounded by the churchyard, from which noble views of the hills are gained. The Vicar, Arnold, read the prayers, Cruikshank the Lesson, &amp; I did the rest at the grave. We returned to Auckland immediately after the service. The day had cleared, the sun was shining, and our road lay through scenes of great natural beauty. Add that the road was in excellent repair that we lunched very comfortably at the Swan Hotel, at Newby Bridge, and had tea at the County Hotel in Kendal, &amp; no more need be said to indicate a pleasant journey. We reached the Castle about 7 p.m., and there awaited me a mountain of accumulated letters.</p></body></text></TEI>
