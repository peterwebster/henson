         <p>I completed my letter to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>, which will, perhaps, have a certain interest as registering the sentiments with which I parted from him.<note xml:id="547" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>That inveterate chatterbox, the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> P. Y. Knight<persName xml:id="4092"></persName>, Vicar of Ryhope, lunched here.
