         <p>O God, whose never&#8211;failing providence ordereth all things both in heaven and earth; We humbly beseech thee to put away from us all hurtful things, and to give us those things which be profitable for us, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
         <p>Amen.</p>
         </div>
         <p>The Epistle contains S Paul's pregnant declaration: "<hi rend="underline">As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God</hi>". And the Gospel includes the solemn warning of Christ: "<hi rend="underline">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven</hi>". The assurance of Divine guidance goes along with the condemnation of those who refuse to follow the Divine guidance. But how shall the Divine Guidance be recognized in a world of fakes and frauds? "<hi rend="underline">The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord</hi>" says the Old Testament. "<hi rend="underline">Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven</hi>" says the New. Are the two sayings ultimately irreconcilable? History is not very easily harmonized with any high theory of ecclesiastical authority. The '<hi rend="underline">prophet</hi>' has a better record than the '<hi rend="underline">priest</hi>', though neither can make out as good a title to Christian regard as might be wished. Probably, we are well advised to put no unlimited trust in either. Both are but second&#8211;hand authorities at best, and in these high concerns of the Spirit we must have a directer [sic] leading.</p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Boden</hi><persName xml:id="2936"></persName> and I walked to South Church, and attended the morning service. It was rather long – Mattins &amp; litany both choral with sermon &amp; 5 hymns. The sermon was a very poor performance. As is but too commonly the practice of very ill&#8211;equipped divines, the preacher chose a subject of the utmost difficulty – the reconciliation of the Pauline doctrines of predestination and universality of God's redemptive purpose. His text was formed of two contrasted passages, Rom: xi. 18 "<hi rend="underline">So then he hath mercy on whom he will, &amp; whom he will he hardeneth</hi>"; and 1. Timothy ii. 3 "<hi rend="underline">who willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth</hi>". The sermon was, of course, extemporaneous, &amp; it was quite obviously unprepared. I could not but reflect on the contrast between the theory of Christian ministry &amp; the actual fact. Any untrained, but devout, Sunday School teacher, with a moderate knowledge of the English Bible and a measure of facility in public speaking, could have preached as well: he could hardly have preached worse.</p>
         <p>The congregation could hardly have exceeded 100 persons, of whom perhaps a dozen, beside the choirmen, were grown males. The population of the parish exceeds 17,000! In the afternoon I wrote several letters viz. to Thelwall, Edward Riches, Ruth Spooner<persName xml:id="2161"></persName>, Gamble<persName xml:id="249"></persName>, &amp; the Chancellor. The letter to the last had reference to the untoward episode at Hartlepool. By way of sweetening the Chancellor's temper, &amp; disposing him to take a lenient view of the Rector's fault, I sent him the proof of the sermon which I preached to the "Free Churchmen" in the new cathedral in Liverpool.</p></body></text></TEI>
