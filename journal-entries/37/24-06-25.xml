         <p>I frittered away the morning very stupidly, writing letters, &amp; preparing notes. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> came to lunch, &amp; afterwards went with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; me to Egglescliffe &amp; Forest, where we instituted the new vicars, Ladell and Coates. The weather, which had an uncertain aspect when we started, improved, &amp; our return was made in the evening sunlight. On our way to Forest, we stopped to see High Force, which was very beautiful, though there was unusually little water in the Fall. Also we visited Perrott in the Vicarage at Middleton, &amp; were pleased to see that the garden is beginning to recover its former beauty.</p></body></text></TEI>
