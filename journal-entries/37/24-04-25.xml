         <p>We left Sandbeck at 10 a.m., and motored to Wyelands, a distance of 170 miles, arriving at 7 p.m. Our route lay by Nottingham, Coventry, Stratford, Ledbury, &amp; Ross. Rain fell heavily most of the morning, &amp; at intervals during the afternoon, but the evening was fine. At Stratford we stopped to visit Shakespeare's tomb. Marie Corelli's funeral was to take place tomorrow. The town was decorated with flags for the annual Festival.</p></body></text></TEI>
