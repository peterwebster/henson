         <p>Still the brilliant hot weather, and the world marvellously beautiful, though beginning to have a parched look. The growing anxiety of the farmers is becoming audible. A failure of the harvest through drought would be no common calamity just now with the famished millions of Central Europe &amp; Russia clamouring for foodstuffs.</p>
         <p>I went to the cathedral at 8 a.m., and celebrated the Holy Communion. Among the communicants were the two boys, Melbourne and Randle, whom I confirmed in the Cathedral on Ascension Day.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">At Mattins I preached in the Cathedral to a considerable congregation</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>My text was "<hi rend="underline">There is one body, &amp; one spirit</hi>", and my subject, the Church. <hi rend="bold underline">I spoke with direct &amp; avowed relation to the controversy about the Enabling Bill, and made as clear a case as I could for the idea of a National Church, and for the maintenance of the Church of England as a national institution</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>In the afternoon the Rev. J. H. Ward<persName xml:id="5045"></persName> came to see me with reference to his appointment as Diocesan Missioner. On the whole he impressed me well.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Compston</hi><persName xml:id="2010"></persName> preached at Evensong in the Cathedral to a very large congregation. He has a fine voice, a good delivery, &amp; excellent matter; he lacks lucidity and the power of arranging his discourse effectively. Charles Scott<persName xml:id="4667"></persName> and the Archdeacon of Hereford<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> came in to supper. There is some sign of a change of weather.</p>
