         <p>I cleared up my study (an Augean stable of dusty papers) and wrote some letters. Herbert<persName xml:id="2285"></persName> &amp; I had a hasty lunch, &amp; then went to London by the 12.50 p.m. express, which brought us into Paddington at 4.20 p.m. After trying in vain to get a room for Friday night at the G.W.R Hotel, I went to Garland's. I had tea in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, where I found Bernard<persName xml:id="225"></persName>, Ridley<persName xml:id="318"></persName>, Macmillan<persName xml:id="1330"></persName>, Ernest<persName xml:id="636"></persName>, &amp; the Archbishop<persName xml:id="128"></persName>. I dined with the Brethren at 4 Little Cloisters.</p>

He had advised the Government not to employ troops against the strikers but to call for volunteers. These in his belief would be forthcoming in ample quantity from the agricultural labourers</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi>
