         <p><hi rend="italic">The newspapers report the death of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">General Botha</hi><persName xml:id="2528"></persName><hi rend="italic">. This is a great loss to the Empire, &amp; will make the situation in South Africa still more difficult.

We discussed the Temperance question.

         <p><hi rend="italic">After lunch he &amp; I walked to the ruins of Roche Abbey, which are most picturesquely situated some 1 1/2 miles from the house. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Fisher</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; I walked home together, &amp; had more conversation after tea. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Lloyd George<persName xml:id="234"></persName> was, he says, the most considerable person at the Paris Conference, the only one who could stand up to old Clemenceau</hi><persName xml:id="4940"></persName><hi rend="i bold">. </hi><hi rend="italic">The latter said of him that he was the only statesman who took a large view of the War. "</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Il parle des grandes choses grandement</hi><hi rend="italic">". When Botha<persName xml:id="2528"></persName> returned from his visit of inquiry to Poland, he summed up his impression of the Poles by the single word 'Kaffirs'. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Scarbrough</hi><persName xml:id="3465"></persName><hi rend="italic"> returned for dinner, bringing with him a pleasant &amp; well&#8211;informed officer, named </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Scovell</hi><persName xml:id="5025"></persName><hi rend="italic">. Captain Grosvenor<persName xml:id="4967"></persName>, a flying man, is also here. </hi>

         <p><hi rend="italic">After dinner we had a great discussion of "Labour."</hi> <hi rend="i doubleunderline">Fisher</hi><hi rend="italic"> expressed himself in terms of high laudation of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">r</hi> <hi rend="i doubleunderline"> Smillie</hi><persName xml:id="4849"></persName><hi rend="italic">, who had introduced a deputation to him, &amp; done so with admirable courtesy &amp; intelligence. A self&#8211;taught man, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Smillie</hi><hi rend="italic"> was a master of considerable knowledge, &amp; naturally, a man of unusual ability. He was a genuine fanatick, &amp; his treatment of noble witnesses at the Coal Commission was an explosion of fanaticism, the impolicy of which he himself now recognised. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Colonel Scovell</hi><hi rend="italic">had personal knowledge of all the Labour leaders. He too had formed a great opinion of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Smillie</hi><hi rend="italic">, whom he held to be an honest but dangerous enthusiast. The iron had entered into </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Smillie's</hi><hi rend="italic"> soul during the years of hardship when he had been "black&#8211;listed"by the mine&#8211;owners, &amp; reduced to great straits of privation. The really dangerous man in the "Labour" movement was a fire&#8211;brand named </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Williams</hi><persName xml:id="5057"></persName><hi rend="italic">, who was a thorough&#8211;going revolutionary. Both </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Fisher</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Scovell</hi><hi rend="italic"> agreed that there existed an unscrupulous element in "Labour" which was "out" for revolution. I was unable to gather much comfort from the conversation. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Arthur Henderson</hi><hi rend="italic"> is thought to be an honest but extremely vain man, whose head has been 'turned' by the prominence into which the War brought him.</hi>
