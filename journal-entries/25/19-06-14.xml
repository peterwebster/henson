         <p>I prepared notes for tomorrow's preaching, &amp; then went to the Bank &amp; arranged for the disposition of the "surrender value" of the policy. James Parker&#8211;Smith<persName xml:id="412"></persName> with his wife<persName xml:id="275"></persName> &amp; daughter<persName xml:id="2658"></persName> arrived for a week&#8211;end visit<hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I received a rather urgently expressed request to be one of a company of six English preachers, who are to visit the United States this autumn. But I could not manage the absence from Hereford without much dislocation of plans, and I am by no means persuaded that I am physically or mentally competent for that kind of effort</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>Yet, of course, there is some justice in the contention that there are some obvious reasons which mark me out rather specially for any reconciling visit to non&#8211;episcopal churches.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">' contains a letter from Rashdall<persName xml:id="117"></persName>, designed as an answer to Sir Edward Clarke<persName xml:id="4002"></persName>, and one signed by Temple<persName xml:id="1173"></persName> and Iremonger brusquely refusing Major's suggestion that a compromise might be effected by amending the Bill. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">It is to be 'the Bill', the whole Bill, &amp; nothing but the Bill'</hi><hi rend="i bold">! </hi><hi rend="italic">I cannot think that this brutal procedure can prevail. Parliament must have changed greatly if it is willing to yield to this hectoring approach.</hi>
