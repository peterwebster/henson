         </p>
         <p>I walked to Westminster and had an interview with Downing at the Ecclesiastical Commission. I asked that Tenbury S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Michael should remain in the diocese of Hereford, &amp; that (if this c<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> not otherwise be conceded) Tenbury itself might be added.</p>
         <p>Then I attended the Chaplain's service in the Abbey. <hi rend="bold underline">I found myself sitting with Ingram<persName xml:id="166"></persName> and Lang<persName xml:id="130"></persName> â€“ an interesting Trinity. </hi>After the service I had a few words with Lang, who was on his way to lunch in Park Lane.</p>
         <p>Then I lunched with the Fieldens<persName xml:id="4560"><persName xml:id="4561"></persName></persName> in 19 Great College Street, and afterwards saw <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> to arrange about our departure tomorrow. Then I went to the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and tried to write a sermon on the Peace for Eton.<note xml:id="489" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>I fell in with Craik<persName xml:id="344"></persName>, and, as I was talking with him, Ker<persName xml:id="22"></persName> came in, &amp; I had some talk with him. I left him the MS. of the Anson<persName xml:id="228"></persName> Memoir<ref xml:id="996"></ref>, &amp; also that of my Westminster sermon.</p>
         <p>I dined with Muir Mackenzie<persName xml:id="601"></persName> at 37 Cumberland Terrace, &amp; had much talk about the Enabling Bill. His daughters, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Clive<persName xml:id="4941"></persName> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">me</hi> Hambourg<persName xml:id="4971"></persName>, were there with their husbands. I walked back to the Hotel, &amp; got in shortly after 11 p.m.</p>
