         <p>The composition of these sermons makes quite sufficient demand on my power of 'giving out' without adding an Article in the <hi rend="underline">Edinburgh Review</hi>, &amp; the work on the Swedish lectures. The choice of subjects is not an easy business for it is straitly conditioned by the limitations of my knowledge and by the purpose, place, occasion etc of my preaching. My own interest must count for something, and the particular requirement of the time. Exegetic preaching is rarely possible, for the appearance of a well&#8211;known Bishop in an important pulpit is assumed to be of significance. It must imply that he intends some sort of a 'pronouncement': the congregation comes together in a temper of expectation, and is apt to resent a sermon of the conventional type.</p>

         <p>After lunch I motored to Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Teme, &amp; called on Prebendary Stallard&#8211;Penoyre<persName xml:id="4117"></persName>. Later I wrote to him offering him the position of Diocesan Missioner. He is, perhaps, rather old for the place, but he is <hi rend="underline">persona grata</hi> to the clergy, and an honest, though rather narrow man. He has had much experience of rural life, &amp; will be able to give much good advice to the rural incumbents. Also, I wrote to Rushton, "acquiescing in" his lawless incense!</p>
