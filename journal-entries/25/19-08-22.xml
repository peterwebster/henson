         <p>A wet and blustering day with a falling glass fulfilled the bad promise of last night. We left Fairlie soon after 10 a.m., and motored to <hi rend="underline">Sauchieburn</hi> a few miles south of Stirling, where we arrived at 4.45 p.m. We lunched with Miss Laurie near Killearn. With her was staying <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Penelope Ker</hi><persName xml:id="4982"></persName>, a sister of W. P. Ker<persName xml:id="22"></persName>. She shewed &amp; expounded the family portraits, &amp; other features of interest in the house. Among these was a chair made out of the wood from the house (now demolished) in which George Buchanan, James VI's tutor, was born; and an autograph poem &amp; letter of Robert Burns<persName xml:id="4936"></persName>. I noticed that there were no corrections in either. The weather steadily improved, &amp; could hardly have been more favourable to a motorist, for there was no wind, changing lights, &amp; a complete absence of dust. Loch Lomond with its girdle of mountains looked its very best. The Castle of Stirling showed up magnificently in the afternoon sun, &amp; seemed to proclaim its historic function as Warden of the Highlands. We passed the field of Bannockburn. After tea, we walked in the woods with our hostess, &amp; on the way admired a distant prospect of the Forth Bridge, &amp; Arthur's Seat. Historic Scotland is amazingly small in area.</p>
