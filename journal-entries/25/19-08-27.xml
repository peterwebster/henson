         <p>I called on the Dean<persName xml:id="114"></persName>, and talked with him for an hour about the future relations of the Cathedral and the University. Then I walked to the School, and had some talk with Budworth<persName xml:id="2692"></persName>, to whom I promised &#x00A3;20 to the new Chapel Fund. I returned by way of the city, and was much delayed by the friendly greetings of old friends. It was rather touching to hear everybody express their regret at my departure, and <hi rend="bold underline">their hope of my return</hi>. Bayley<persName xml:id="2806"></persName> came in after lunch and had some talk. Then I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp;, when the service was over, had half&#8211;an&#8211;hour's conversation with <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>. <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Cruickshank</hi><persName xml:id="2663"></persName> most kindly shewed <hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><persName xml:id="4501"></persName> over the Cathedral: and then C. and I walked together for an hour. The weather was blustering, &amp; threatened rain, but no rain actually fell, and there were bursts of sunshine which showed up the fair country very beautifully. After dinner a considerable number of old acquaintances came in to meet us. I was again surprised and gratified by the warmth of their expressions of regard. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ellershaw<persName xml:id="3460"></persName> spoke out with much good sense of the present extravagances of feminism. Miss Storey, a very beautiful young lady, was wearing two stars, awarded for war&#8211;service. The Cuthbert Vauxes<persName xml:id="5041"></persName> were there. They are now living in the house where Col: Darwin<persName xml:id="3512"></persName> used to live.</p>
