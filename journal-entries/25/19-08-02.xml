         <p><hi rend="italic">How far is this true? Does Christian history bear out the statement that Christians have not differed about morals? Asceticism determines large departments of human practice, can it be said, </hi><hi rend="italic underline">either</hi><hi rend="italic">, that it has bred no differences among Christians, </hi><hi rend="italic underline">or</hi><hi rend="italic">, that these differences are not properly said to be about morals? </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Is not Christianity divided at this moment on the subject of marriage</hi><hi rend="i bold">? </hi><hi rend="italic">And can that division be excluded from the description of moral differences? Marriage may, indeed, be regarded as an institution, &amp; the Christian view of it held to be properly determined by Scripture, or by the Church i.e. by an external authority. But take the larger subject of 'purity' is there complete agreement among Christians as to what it means, &amp; requires? Can the Roman Catholic, tied fast to the traditional asceticism, think in the same way about sexual relations as the Protestant, who frankly repudiates the ascetical point of view?</hi>

         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The legitimacy of War has been hotly denied by the Quakers &amp; many other Christians – is there no moral issue involved</hi><hi rend="i bold">?</hi>

         <p><hi rend="italic">'Temperance' is identified with 'total abstinence' by many thousands of English &amp; American Christians, who therein have severed themselves, not only from the general tradition of historic Christianity but also from the majority of existing Christians. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Is this not truly called a moral issue? </hi><hi rend="italic">There is the sharpest division on economic and political issues, does not this push into the category of morals? </hi>
         </p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">But, indeed, does not Whichcote really answer himself when he says that ' he that produceth the best reason in morals is to be closed with', for this implies discussion of reasons, decision as to which is the best, &amp; the opportunity for differences of opinion?</hi>
         </p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">It would seem that there is no better assurance of agreement among Christians in the realm of morals, than in that of institutions. And the probability of difference increases with the growing complexity of civilized life, &amp; the waxing of knowledge</hi><hi rend="i bold">. </hi><hi rend="italic">Take such a new question as that which is now pressing for decision – </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">the legitimacy in point of Christian morality of using contra&#8211;conceptive methods.

         <p><hi rend="italic">Atheism is to reasonable religion what Prohibition is to temperance – an extreme which has become a perversion. The excuse for Atheism is extremely unreasonable Religion allowed to monopolize the name and claim of Religion. The excuse for Drunkenness is Prohibition (compulsory total abstinence) allowed to monopolize the name and claim of Temperance. The total abstainer's mind is filled with 2 assumptions: 1. Alcoholic beverages are poisonous. 2. Total abstinence from alcoholic drink is identical with temperance. We may add a third in the case of religious total abstainers – That wine in the Bible means unfermented grape juice. The 1</hi><hi rend="i sup u">st</hi><hi rend="italic"> justifies coercion: the 2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="italic"> guarantees results: the 3</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rd</hi><hi rend="italic"> disarms Christian opposition. Discussion with total abstainers always leads to no result because these assumptions destroy its actuality. "Freedom", "temperance", "wine" – mean different things.</hi>
