         <p>"so I say no more at present than that I feel, in the interest not of ecclesiastical union (which is a long way off) but of healthy &amp; Christian religion in England this exclusive principle must be stood up to. If all liberal evangelical Churchmen had your clarity of vision &amp; courage in act it would be done in a day, but some good people are weak reeds when it comes to a point".</p>

         <p>I agree so far that the shortsightedness &amp; timidity of the Evangelicals are the main obstacles.</p>
