         <p>The weather, which had been very cold, suddenly became very warm. I spent the whole morning in writing letters, &amp; in continuing work on the Anson<persName xml:id="228"></persName> Memoir<ref xml:id="996"></ref>. In the afternoon I walked with Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> as far as Belmont, where we looked at the Roman Catholic Cathedral<placeName xml:id="97"></placeName>.</p>

He was to put up at the Palace for the night. He is a short little man, inclining to stoutness, &amp; rather insignificant in appearance. He has, however, an ample brow, and an intelligent eye.
