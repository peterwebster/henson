         <p><hi rend="bold underline">We left Sandbeck Park<placeName xml:id="95"></placeName> at 10.20 a.m.</hi>, and carried Fisher<persName xml:id="2107"></persName> to the railway station at Worksop. Then we continued our journey, through Chesterfield, Bakewill, Buxton, Leek, the Potteries, Market Drayton, &amp; Shrewsbury to Condover Hall, which we reached about 6 p.m. Much time was lost in getting through the towns, especially Chesterfield (where the crookedness of the church&#8211;spine seems to have affected the streets!) and we spent an hour over meals, but the car travelled steadily: &amp; the weather was favourable. </p>
         <p>I walked in the garden for an hour before dinner talking over the national situation with mine host. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fielden</hi><persName xml:id="4560"></persName> is an excellent specimen of the successful British merchant, &amp; his opinion is worth having. He cannot be called optimistic. He cannot see how the country is to pay its way. He would impose a tax of 1/&#8211; in the &#x00A3; on all wages above 30/&#8211; a week. After dinner we resumed the discussion. He confesses with an almost child&#8211;like simplicity that he is not satisfied in conscience with the position which he and his class are holding. The 'depersonalizing' of the industrial system is the prime cause of the present discontents, and he can see no prospect of any change. Probably the real cause lies deeper, and cannot be affected by the action of individuals, however able &amp; well intending.</p>
