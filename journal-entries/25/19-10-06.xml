         <p>The terms of the settlement appear on the whole satisfactory and are substantially what the Government offered before the strike was declared. In these circumstances it is not easy to see why Thomas<persName xml:id="5036"></persName> sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> have rec<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> an 'ovation' unless indeed the public still credits him with an influence favourable to peace, &amp; supposes that he has succeeded in restraining the 'wild men'. After inflicting on the nation immense discomfort and loss, &amp; adding greatly to the financial burden of the State, now visibly on the brink of bankruptcy, the Railwaymen return to work, without any kind of punishment, and even amid general applause as if they were performing a fine action! Such is democracy!</p>

It appears alongside of the report of a meeting in Hereford at which the Agricultural Labourers' Union proclaimed its adhesion to the Railwaymen, &amp; there was an orgy of tall and heated oratory! If I have hitherto enjoyed an undeserved reputation for sympathising with "Labour", it will hardly survive so arresting and complete a discord of opinion on a "Labour" conflict</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>
