         <p>I spent the morning in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> writing letters etc.: and, after lunch, I walked with Ernest<persName xml:id="636"></persName> to Lambeth for the Bishops' Meeting. The discussion continued, with a brief interlude for tea, until 7 p.m., but did not lead up to anything practical. </p>

The Bishop of Wakefield<persName xml:id="2980"></persName> gave a rather alarming account of a new clerical association which is out to block every effort of the Episcopate. <hi rend="bold underline">I interjected an inquiry whether this were the Life &amp; Liberty movement: &amp; all their lordships laughed, being mostly members of that society</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I dined with mine host, and went early to bed after a futile &amp; wasted day.</p>
