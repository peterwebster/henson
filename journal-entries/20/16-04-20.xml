<hi>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. The <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName> was celebrant. <persName xml:id="1178" display="no">Clarence Stock</persName> went away by the early train. I started work on the Sermon for S. George's, Windsor. It is difficult to choose a subject, and even to find a text. The words of Zechariah might serve for text of a sermon on the Consecration of Nationality: "</hi><hi rend="underline">In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holy unto the Lord; and the pots of the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar</hi><hi>". (xiv. 20) The reign of Edward III witnessed a great outbreak of national self&#8211;consciousness in England, &amp; this fact found expression in many directions: Wycliffe, Chaucer, Langland belong to this time. There was a new spirit of self&#8211;assertion in Religion, in Law, in Literature, in Society, in Architecture. Of the last S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> George's, Windsor, is itself a notable illustration. The perpendicular style is peculiarly English, and exhibits the best national characteristics – simplicity, a certain severe altitude [sic], a love of light and space. The churches were adapting themselves in advance to the requirements of the Reformation. It was the great age of Chivalry, as the institution of the Order of the Garter sufficiently indicates. It was also an age of violent economic dislocation, &amp; social unrest, of protracted War, of the Black Death. All this may connect itself with the present time, &amp; give actuality to my preaching.</hi>
