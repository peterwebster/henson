<persName xml:id="2692"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Budworth</hi></persName> came to consult me about a letter he had received inviting him to offer himself as a candidate for the Headmastership of Malvern School. He interpreted this as practically implying an offer of the post, &amp; "thought we ought to have the chance of getting rid of him if we wished". I told him that we had great confidence in him, should regard his retirement as a grave misfortune to the school, counted on him to captain the school through the present crisis. He thereupon said that he would at once decline to offer himself as a candidate at Malvern. I told him that, if he stayed here, and saw the new house floated successfully, he would have the rare distinction of having lifted the School on to a higher level.
