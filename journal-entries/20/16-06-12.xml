<hi>The weather is cold, wet, and tempestuous. Branches were twisted from the trees by the wind, and the paths were sprinkled with green leaves. I spent the morning in my study, and read <persName xml:id="2926">Brightman's</persName> "English Rite". I attended Evensong. <persName xml:id="2819">Lady Londonderry</persName> with a party consisting of E. F. <persName xml:id="3753">Benson</persName> ("Dodo"), M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Salzer, &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Jamieson, Sir Douglas Haig's sister, arrived during service, and were regaled afterwards with sweet musick. I showed them over the Cathedral; and then we all had tea, &amp; they saw over the Deanery. After their departure, I walked with <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> to D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3752">Stenhouse's</persName> residence. Here he was inspected, &amp; obtained a letter about his health.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I took up at random a book which I found curiously interesting:–</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>"</hi><hi rend="underline">An Account of the State of the Roman–Catholick Religion throughout the World. Written for the use of Pope Innocent XI, by Monsignor Cerri, Secretary of the Congregation de propagandâ Fide</hi><hi>. Now first translated from an Authentick Italian MS. never publish'd, to which is added, A Discourse concerning the State of Religion in England. Written in French, in the Time of K. Charles I, and now first translated. With a large Dedication to the Present Pope; giving him a very particular account of the State of Religion amongst Protestants; &amp; of several other matters of importance relating to Great Britain. By </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Richard Steele</hi><hi>. London. Printed for J. Roberts, near the Oxford Arms in Warwick–Lane. MDCCXV."</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The Dedication is not without interest, as drawing a hostile but not wholly unfaithful picture of the Church of England at the Accession of George I. There is a curious relevance to present conditions: &amp;, indeed, much of it reads like a satire on the Anglicanism of the XX</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century. </hi>
