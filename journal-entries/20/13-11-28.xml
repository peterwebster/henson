<persName xml:id="3565"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Plunket</hi></persName> called this afternoon. He is staying with the <persName xml:id="2920">Master of University College</persName> who came with him. He came to Durham yesterday to preside at a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="271">Victoria League</orgName>. The meeting appears to have been a dismal affair, an audience of 25 persons having collected in the Town Hall &amp; making but a poor show. Lord Plunket is a pleasant fairâ€“haired man of slight build &amp; unimpressive appearance. We talked of the political situation, of Ireland, of <hi rend="italic">the Female Suffrage Movement, of Eugenics. His experience as Governor of New Zealand (where Female Suffrage exists)</hi> does not seem to have induced him to adopt the cause. Mainly he thinks it makes little difference, save to increase the Labour Vote.
