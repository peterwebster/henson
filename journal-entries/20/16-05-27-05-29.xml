<hi rend="italic">I wrote letters, cleared up my study in some measure, lunched, and went off to Edinburgh, where I continued until Monday as the guest of the Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi> <hi rend="i doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3547">Norman Maclean</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">, one of the two ministers of S. Cuthbert's, at 5 Cluny Avenue. At dinner on Saturday, I met <persName xml:id="3928">another Maclean</persName>, who for some while had been chaplaining at the front. He told me that he had conducted a very successful Church Parade, jointly with the Anglican chaplain, and that this arrangement had been summarily disallowed to the great chagrin of the officers &amp; men. He said that some of the officers had made energetic protests, but of course without effect. The incident had had the worst effect. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Bishop <persName xml:id="3765">Gwynne</persName> would seem to be as narrow as the rest</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
            </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">On Sunday I preached twice in S. Cuthbert's, and wore (at the request of the ministers) my surplice &amp; cassock. I apprehend that these garments had not been seen in that church since the 16</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> century. 'We are getting on' as the <persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister</persName> observed! </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I was surprised to hear Maclean, in the course of his intercessory prayer, pray openly for the dead</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi><hi rend="italic"> In the morning I preached from S. Matthew XVI. 3, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Ye know how to discern the face of the heaven: but ye cannot discern the signs of the times</hi><hi rend="italic">." In the evening my text was Psalm 119.96: "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">I see that all things come to an end; but Thy commandment is exceeding broad</hi><hi rend="italic">." This was an old sermon, slightly adapted, and this was the 9</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> occasion on which I had preached it. The congregations were very large, &amp; very attentive. I was particularly interested to see many ministers from the General Assemblies present. I lunched at the New Club with <persName xml:id="227">Willie Murray</persName>. There was a thunderstorm during the afternoon, &amp; very sultry atmosphere.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3766">Fisher</persName></hi><hi>, the other minister of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Cuthbert's, came to supper after service. He was made a Trustee of his property by my old friend </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="1135">Mitford Mitchell</persName></hi><hi>. The whole clerical staff of S. Cuthbert's is two ministers &amp; three assistants. Though this is the old parish church of Edinburgh, the parishioners do not possess the sittings, which are let by the "heritors".<note xml:id="309" n="1"></note> </hi>
            </p>
         <p>
<hi>At the evening service, if I was not misinformed, the sittings were open to the public. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I noticed in the vestry a picture of Erasmus</hi><hi>, surely a strange figure to be thus honoured in a Presbyterian Church. I gave copies of my little book on <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson of Brighton"</ref> to Fisher, Maclean, &amp; W. Murray. I declined invitations to both the Moderators' Breakfasts, and came away by the 10 a.m. express. I was back in the Deanery about 2 p.m. in good time to attend Evensong, and mount the Tower for the Neville's Cross Anthems afterwards.<note xml:id="76" n="1"></note> Last year I had expressed the hope that peace would have come back to us before we climbed the Tower again: but the hope has been dashed, &amp; we are still in the grip of a War, which seems endless. I gave <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> 24/&#8211; to distribute among the choirboys. They at least may be counted on as champions of the custom! <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> brought the young Jersey student in to tea. A letter from </hi><persName xml:id="3566"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Foakes&#8211;Jackson</hi></persName><hi> (which had been opened by the Censor) gives the very interesting information that he has been offered the Professorship which was held by the late D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="2044">Briggs</persName>, &amp; which carries an income of &#x00A3;1280 and a pension. He thinks he will accept it as 'its only four lectures a week'. America seems to be buying up such scholarship as yet lingers in the Church of England. <persName xml:id="3172">Kirsopp Lake</persName> at Harvard; &amp; Foakes Jackson at New York, ought to count for a good deal. </hi>
