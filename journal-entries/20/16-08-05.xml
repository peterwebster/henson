<hi>I wrote to <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> before breakfast, &amp; afterwards to <persName xml:id="2523">Simpson</persName>, <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh's</persName> brother&#8211;in&#8211;law, and to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName> &amp; his mother came to spend the week&#8211;end. The <persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName> with a lady attended Evensong, and came in afterwards for tea. He was vastly interested in the volume of <persName xml:id="3934">Raemacker's</persName> cartoons, which he had not previously seen. I walked with Hugh for an hour before dinner, &amp; had much converse with him. <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> made his appearance, and stayed to dinner. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3914">Dunn</persName>, the Superintendent of Police, came to see me about the service tomorrow. He proposes to bring the Special Constables, to the number of about 200, to the Cathedral, &amp; had already consulted <persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName> about providing them with seats. They are to occupy the North Transept: the <orgName xml:id="193">Boys' Scouts</orgName> from the parishes are to be placed in the south Transept. The Mayor &amp; Corporation with their female relations, &amp; followers of the City will have the whole Nave at their disposal. The question is, will they be able to fill it?</hi>
