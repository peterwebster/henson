<hi>The brilliant hot weather continues. I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8a.m. in S. Cuthbert's Church. The beauty of the situation, the austere dignity of the building &amp; the freshness of the morning gave an extraordinary charm to the solemn yet simple service. A thrush had come into the church, and abode by the altar, from time to time interjecting its cry: but mainly it was a piously&#8211;disposed bird, &amp; did not disturb the service. I attended Mattins, which was abbreviated, &amp; with a sermon which took but a few minutes, only occupied 50 minutes! In the afternoon we sate in chairs and talked until Evensong at 6.30p.m. when I preached the same little sermon which did duty at Buckingham Palace. There was a considerable &amp; very attentive congregation. After supper we walked up the hill with the squire (Hutchinson) and his ladies.</hi>
