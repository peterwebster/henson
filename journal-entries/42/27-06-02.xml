<hi>I left the Castle at 9.30 a.m., and motored to Morpeth, 41 miles, and there attended the meeting of the </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Newcastle Diocesan Conference</hi><hi>. I spoke in support of a resolution approving the Revised Prayer Book. An amendment was moved by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Campbell Fraser</hi><hi>, the Rector of Bedlington, &amp; supported by speeches of almost incredible fatuity. After lunching in a Hotel, the Conference resumed, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Hugh Cecil</hi><hi> defended the Revised Book in a curiously sophisticated speech, very characteristic and adroit. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hudson</hi><hi>, an Anglo&#8211;Catholick incumbent recently arrived in the Diocese from Leeds, made a speech in which he announced the resolve of himself &amp; his friends to take no part in the division. How many votes they represented I do not know, but the resolution approving the Book was finally adopted by 214 votes to 23. After the meeting, I went to Newminster ^Abbey^ and had tea with the owner, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir George Renwick</hi><hi>. His wife, a pleasant old lady who assisted her deafness with an ear&#8211;trumpet, was there, &amp; some grand&#8211;daughters. I arrived back in the Castle a few minutes before 7 p.m.: &amp; found that Colonel and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Marsh had left, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Gow arrived.</hi>
