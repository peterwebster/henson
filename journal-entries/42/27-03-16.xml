<hi>The </hi><hi rend="underline">Modern Churchman</hi><hi> arrived. It contains an article by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Major</hi><hi> on "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Composite Book from the Modernist Point of View</hi><hi>", which is rather surprisingly favourable to the Book. He approves both the new Communion Office, &amp; Reservation for the Sick. There is also an Article by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rashdell</hi><hi> on '</hi><hi rend="underline">Bishop Butler</hi><hi>' which is a severe &amp; powerful criticism of my greatest predecessor. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He holds that Butler's 'Fifteen Sermons' are his most important work. "When I taught Moral Philosophy in Oxford, I always recommended men to begin by reading Butler's Sermons, or some of them, &amp; Mill's Utilitarianism as the typical representation of the two classical schools of Moral Philosophy</hi><hi rend="bold">."</hi>

<hi>I motored to Durham, &amp; instituted </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon Patterson</hi><hi> to Aycliffe, licensed a sinister looking fellow called </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Chambers</hi><hi> to Brandon, and gave a preacher's license to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Morley Wells</hi><hi>. Then I lunched at the County Club with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wilson</hi><hi>. There was at lunch a pleasant fellow who lives near Aycliffe, &amp; is named, I think, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Summerson</hi><hi>. He is interested in birds, &amp; has travelled.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> &amp; I motored to Greatham where I confirmed 49 candidates. Then we went on to West Hartlepool, where I confirmed 83, in S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t. </hi><hi>Aidan's Church. Here the males actually outnumbered the females, an almost unheard of phenomenon. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The clergy without exception declared themselves well&#8211;pleased with the Composite Book</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi>We returned to Auckland immediately after the Confirmations.</hi>
