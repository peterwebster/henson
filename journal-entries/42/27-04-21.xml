<hi>^[paragraph strikethrough]^ </hi><hi rend="italic">Fawkes writes to say that he is "delighted" to see my reply to Cardinal Bourne's "extraordinarily unseemly performance at York. I wonder that so astute a person should have chosen Easter Sunday for such a discourse." Then he gives a run to his favourite bonnet&#8211;bee: "I rejoice to see that you are 'the favourite' for Lambeth &#8211; if one may use a secular term." Well, well!!</hi>

The Non&#8211;episcopalians are polite but frigid: the Papists are rude and hostile. Beyond some hollow philandering with the Orientals, there is nothing to show. And I think that the domestic situation has been worsened. The Anglo&#8211;Catholick movement was directly concerned with defeating the attempt to get into touch with the Presbyterians and Nonconformists: and its success has necessarily emphasized &amp; embittered the strife of parties within the Church of England. Prayer&#8211;book Revision adds a new cause of dissidence and conflict: &amp; what the end will be none can tell.</hi>
