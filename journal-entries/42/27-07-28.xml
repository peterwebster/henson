<hi>The Labrador Retriever puppy which I presented to Lady Maureen Stanley is reported to have arrived safely, and given satisfaction.</hi>

<hi>I read through a very informing and well–written article in the current Hibbert Journal on ''The Fourth Gospel and some recent criticism'' by Vincent Taylor, Ph.D., D.D.(Lond), a writer who is unknown to me. ''The position, as Lightfoot saw it, has caved in. No one can prove, and scarcely anyone attempts to prove that the Fourth Gospel is the composition of the son of Zebedee'' but he adds 'Be the authorship what it may, the connection between the witness of this Gospel and so much that goes under the name of historical Christianity is both intimate and vital. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Substantially, the issue is whether or not the Pauline theology has any factual basis</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> It was clearly the evangelist's conviction that it had such a basis, and it was to convey this belief to others that he wrote. But was he justified in holding this conviction? Is he an interpreter of history, or an artist embodying his dreams?' The whole article is well worth reading as a summary of the controversy as it stands today. It will be interesting to see what light Bernard's new commentary on the Gospel, which is now in the press, will throw on the subject.</hi>

<hi>Projected Appointments – </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>1. Shaddick from New Shildon to South Westoe</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>2. Morris Young . Stillington . New Shildon</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>3. Douglas . Hart . Stillington</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>4. Wilson . Stanley . Hart</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>5. Heselton . Gateshead . Stanley</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>6. ^[item strikethrough]^ Fodden . Consett . Seaton Carew</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>7. Coates . Forest . ^[item strikethrough]^ Consett</hi>

<hi>S. James's Hartlepool</hi>

<hi>This will leave to Lord Barnard the task of finding another Vicar for Forest, which is too remote and unimportant to matter.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I wrote to Coates saying vaguely that when I returned from my holiday, I hoped to propose him an appointment which would give him a more adequate sphere of ministry than Forest provides.</hi>

<hi>Sykes came to see about his assistant–curate, who has straightway shown the white feather on finding his lodgings at Fishburn less comfortable than he expected. He now longs passionately to return to Barnard Castle, where he asks my permission to apply for the school chaplaincy. After talking the matter over with Sykes I gave him the permission, but accompanied it with a withering letter, which ought to make him feel extremely uncomfortable.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then we motored to Durham, where the ladies went to see the buildings and attend M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Vaux's garden party. I went to Newcastle and had my hair cut, returning to join them at the said party. Here I had some talk with Dillon, who suggested that I should write to a gentleman named Knott, a man ''worth at least £4,000,000'' and ask him to help in restoring the Castle. He is not hopeful about the immediate future of the mining Industry but thinks that the superior quality of the Durham coal will secure the ultimate recovery of the coal–mining.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The Very Rev. S. P. D. Lloyd, Dean of Nova Scotia, writes to claim my good offices in securing for him an appointment preferably in the South of Europe, with an income of not less than £850, where he may spend the closing years of his ministry in a milder climate than that of Newfoundland!!!</hi>
