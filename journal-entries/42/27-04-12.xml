<hi>I began a sermon for Easter Da, but I have lost the art of sermon&#8211;making, or, perhaps, I never possessed it, &amp; have only now discovered the fact!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The post brought me letters from William, Gilbert Simpson, and Gerald Rainbow. Also </hi><hi rend="bold">/</hi><hi> I received a letter from that wonderful old man, Page Roberts, written with his own hand:</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>My dear Lord,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>It is a pleasure as well as a surprise that a thought for me, in my obscurity, should have flitted over your mind. I thank you heartily, &amp; I thank you for the words of light &amp; leading contained in your lecture. I never fail to study with serious devotion the words of yours which appear in print, although Episcopal utterances are sometimes too much for my feeble intelligence now ninety one years old.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Again, I thank you &amp; remain, my Lord,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Yours gratefully,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>

<hi>Lionel and I motored to Gainford where I confirmed about 40 persons in the fine old parish church. The service was reverent &amp; gave the impression of sincerity.</hi>
