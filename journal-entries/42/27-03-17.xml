<hi>I have received an invitation to be the Guest of the Evening and propose the principal toast on the occasion of the Annual Commemorative Dinner of the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Robert Louis Stevenson</hi><hi> Club on November 12</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: and (though my acquaintance with R.L.S. is by no means intimate) I incline to accept, though it will make an appreciable addition to my labours to do so. I suppose this invitation is the consequence of my having made the speech at the Scott dinner.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Spencer Wade</hi><hi> writes to thank me for the book, &amp; to confess his own sympathy with the Modernists on the cardinal matter of Christ's Deity. I was moved to write to him forthwith. He also suggested that Karlgren's "</hi><hi rend="underline">Bolshevist Russia</hi><hi>" should be abridged, &amp; issued in a cheap form. He offered himself to undertake the abridgement, &amp; I forwarded this suggestion to the publisher of the book.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Henry Craik's</hi><hi> death was announced in the evening paper. I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Craik</hi><hi> to condole with him on his father's death. The old man was full of whimsical egotisms, but he was good natured, &amp; I had a true regard for him.</hi>
