<hi>I spent the morning in completing an address for the soldiers at the dedicating of the Walencourt Cross next Sunday, and then in preparing a discourse for the Mothers' Union next Monday, when they gather in the Cathedral. After lunch I walked in the Park with Ernest and Nigel Cornwall.</hi>

<hi>Nigel and Lionel went with me to South Shields, and we picked up Cecil Ferens in Durham. I "admitted" Shaddick to the perpetual curacy of South Westoe in the presence of a large congregation. The Mayor of South Shields walked in the procession, &amp; so did the Chief Constable, &amp; three sectarian ministers in their gowns. It was apparent that the people have taken to their new Vicar very heartily. He is a good fellow, with a pleasant face and a frank open manner, which conciliates everybody. Woods follows him from New Shildon, &amp; thus returns to South Shields, where he began his ministry under the tactless and luckless Pryke. I interviewed M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Baker an Ordination candidate before service. Afterwards we returned to Auckland.</hi>
