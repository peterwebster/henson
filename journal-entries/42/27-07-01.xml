<hi>I set to work on the York sermon, and finished it by lunch&#8211;time. </hi>

<hi>In the afternoon James came to say Goodbye. I gave him my photograph, as I had promised: we said prayers together, and parted with real emotion. It is odd to reflect that he will no more be in the house: for, whether the doctor passes him for work at sea or not, his service in my house is ended. Everytime I repeat this process of parting, I register a vow that I will no more allow myself to care for anybody, and everytime the old absurdity repeats itself!</hi>

<hi>Ella and I motored through rain to Bishopthorpe to stay the night with the Archbishop. The other guests were Lord &amp; Lady Pinmer, the Bishop of Corea (Trollope), Olaf's brother&#8211;in&#8211;law who is going as junior curate to Whitby, &amp; Crawley the Chaplain. We had much pleasant talk. Lord Pinmer, and still more his lady, were evidently by no means well&#8211;disposed to the Bishop of Durham: &amp; I think I know the reason, for they are "Anglo&#8211;Catholicks" and he is a supporter of the Liverpool Bill, and was in the H. of L. when I spoke against it.</hi>
