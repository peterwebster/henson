<hi>I motored to Darlington, and took the early train to King's Cross. From York I enjoyed the luxury of solitude. On arrival in London I drove to the Atheneum: had my hair cut: proceeded to Lambeth, and sate with my brethren in conference during the afternoon.</hi>

<hi rend="bold underline">We received an impudent memorandum from the E.C.U. asking us to postpone the Revision until the Church was more united! The whole thing was very hypocritically expressed</hi><hi>. The Bishop of Exeter moved, &amp; the Bishop of Birmingham seconded a motion that only the non&#8211;contentious part of the Revision should be proceeded with. This was lost by 29 to 4. The minority consisted of Exeter, Birmingham, Newcastle &amp; Worcester. Then we got to work on the suggestions made by the Convocations.</hi>

<hi>The Archbishop was cheerful and communicative. He has been having many interviews with dissentients: and on the whole seems to be less discouraged than might have appeared natural. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Frere</hi><hi> told me that he was regarded as a traitor by the Anglo&#8211;Catholicks but he thought they were 'bluffing': and would find themselves without followers when the pinch of decision came.</hi>
