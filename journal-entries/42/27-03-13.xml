<hi>The Ordination in the chapel was a simple but not an undignified function. A choir was provided by the undergraduates of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> John's College, Durham, and did its duty very well. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Ferguson</hi><hi> came from Collierley to see his assistant ordained, and brought with him five of his church officers</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Linnell</hi><hi>'s parents were in the congregation, which was swollen by some visitors. The Bishop of Jarrow preached the sermon, and presented the candidate. I was pleased with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Linnell</hi><hi> who gave the impression of sincerity. After the service we entertained 29 persons for lunch.</hi>

<hi>Wilson and I went into Durham, where I had tea in 16 North Bailey before going to Belmont. There I preached in Jimmie's Mission. The little iron building was filled with a very well&#8211;behaved congregation. Jimmie read the prayers very decently: &amp; the lessons were read by a young School Teacher from the Council School of the district. After service Jimmie came with me as far as his sister's house in the descent of the hill into Bishop Auckland.</hi>
