<hi>I spent the morning in writing letters and then in reading again </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Coulton</hi><hi>'s chapters on the Cistercian Order in his "</hi><hi rend="underline">Five Centuries of Religion</hi><hi>". I also read </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hamilton Thompson</hi><hi>'s chapter on the </hi><hi rend="underline">Monastic Orders</hi><hi> in </hi><hi rend="underline">Cambridge Medieval History</hi><hi> vol V. The one writer's sympathies are strongly Protestant: the other's are strongly Catholick: but both are genuine scholars and write honestly. On the whole I think </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Coulton</hi><hi>'s is the truest account of Medieval Monasticism.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Jackson</hi><hi>, the Rector of Long newton, lunched here. He came to ask permission to resign his benefice, a permission which his face, horribly distorted by some dreadful operation, significantly justified. But he wants a pension, which will reduce the income of his successor to a woeful pittance.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> gave another lesson in golf: but my performance is humiliating in its badness. There can be no doubt that the spectacle of a man of 64 essaying to learn a game which should be mastered in youth is ludicrous from one point of view, and pathetick from another!</hi>
