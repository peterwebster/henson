<hi>I spent the morning in writing ^a^ sermon for the youth whom I was pledged to address in the evening, being interrupted by the Vicar of Barnard Castle, who arrived with another clergyman, an applicant for the vacant assistant&#8211;curacy. Sykes came to lunch, with the object of making the final arrangements about the Auckland Brotherhood meeting on June 29</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>. I bade him settle everything with Lionel and Alexander, &amp; promised to "honour the bill"! Then I walked in the Park, and had some pleasant talk with some miners whom I encountered. Evidently there have been fresh discharges from the pits.</hi>

<hi>Lionel and I motored to Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring, where I preached to a crowded congregation of Church Lads Brigade, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, &amp;c &amp;c, assembled to inaugurate a "Council of Youth" for the Rural Deanery. After the service the lads &amp; girls who were in uniform lined the Churchyard, and I spoke to them. Then I dined at the Rectory. On the whole, I was pleased with the service, and, save for some coughing by the younger children, the attention was close. We returned to Auckland Castle in time to get speech with Car√∂e, who had arrived in order to attend the function at Escomb tomorrow.</hi>
