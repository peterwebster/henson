<hi>The excitement of the morning was the arrival of the new car, which has a very handsome appearance &amp; costs &#x00A3;775. It is an Austin 23 h.p.</hi>

<hi>I spent the morning in reading about Freemasonry, and never wrote a line of my sermon. Jimmie arrived after lunch, and walked round the Park with me. </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Then the Auckland Brotherhood began to arrive</hi><hi rend="italic">. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Shebbcase</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; a party arrived at tea&#8211;time. He is recovering from his defeat over the Margaret Professorship, &amp; finds consolation in the relatively considerable number of the votes cast for him.</hi>

<hi rend="italic underline">About 60 members of the Auckland Brotherhood dined.</hi><hi rend="italic"> The Bishops of Rochester, Wakefield, Lichfield, Dover (Newcastle), the Deans of Windsor &amp; Norwich, and others were already known to me. Everybody seemed to be fraternal and pleasant. Compline was impressive as we used the organ. Then we dispersed with the most valourous protestations of our determination to see the eclipse tomorrow, though it means getting up at 4.30 a.m.!</hi>
