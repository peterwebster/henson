<hi>I received, corrected, and returned the proofs of the </hi><hi rend="underline">Earl Grey Memorial Lecture</hi><hi>; and told the Secretary of the C.O.S. in London that I would "take" 200 copies of my Loch Memorial Lecture.</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">In the afternoon the three lads, whom I had invited to see the Castle made their appearance. I showed them round, &amp; gave them tea. One was a boot–maker; one, a "petrol–seller, the third a "putter" in a pit. They had all passed either the 6</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> or the 7</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">th </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">standard in school, and all confessed to reading nothing but the police &amp; football news</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> When they had departed, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">J. G. Wilson</hi><hi> arrived in order to administer his oaths and declarations to the deacon–designate, who is to be ordained tomorrow. Later the said deacon-designate </hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Gerald Hyslop Linnell</hi><hi>, appeared with his wife, both looking absurdly young. After dinner I had some speech with him, taking occasion to warn him against being immediately swept into the fatuous polemic against the Composite Book which his foolish Vicar, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Ferguson</hi><hi>, has been carrying on. It is certainly most unfortunate to have to put an assistant curate on his guard against the fervour of his Vicar! But </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Ferguson</hi><hi> has worked himself up into a ridiculous fervour, joined the Protestant Pilgrims and imagines himself a second Luther! Apparently he has created a considerable excitement among the pitmen of Collierley, who have visions of racks &amp; stakes as imminent catastrophes!</hi>
