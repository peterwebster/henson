<hi>James showed me two nests of thrushes which he had discovered yesterday. I motored to Darlington, and caught the 11.21 a.m. express to King's Cross. My travelling companion was a young lady of the modern type, who powdered her nose, &amp; lit her cigarette (though it was a non&#8211;smoking carriage) with the utmost assurance. However, she improved on acquaintance. Her father, she told me, was a Yorkshire squire, who held a prominent rank among the Freemasons. She told me his name. But I have already forgotten it. She"runs" Girl Guides, and plays the organ in her parish church.</hi>

         <p><hi>On arriving at King's Cross I drove to 21 Park Lane, and deposited my bags. Then I went to the hair&#8211;dresser: and afterwards went to the Club, and wrote to Ella. The Bishop of Norwich was there, and most friendly. We walked to Dean's Yard, &amp; I called vainly on Storr. His pretty daughter, who is just engaged to be married, was there. Then I returned to the Athenaeum, and dined with Newbott, Perceval, and Graves. I walked back to Park Lane, where I found Lord Scarbrough, and had some talk with him before going to bed.</hi>
