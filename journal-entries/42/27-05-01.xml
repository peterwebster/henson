<hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We were only 6 communicants. After breakfast I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><hi>, &amp; to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Oldmeadow</hi><hi>, the Editor of the </hi><hi rend="underline">Tablet</hi><hi>, who had sent me copies of his paper containing articles written by himself, </hi><hi rend="underline">in which I am copiously criticised</hi><hi>! These articles are excellent specimens of Roman controversial method, very smart &amp; effective, but begging every question that matters, &amp; calculated with attorney&#8211;like skill to draw the opponent into some logical ambush!</hi>

<hi>Lionel and I motored to West Hartlepool, &amp; there in S'. James's Church, I dedicated memorials and preached. After the service we had tea with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Prideaux</hi><hi>. His predecessor, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bailey</hi><hi> with his wife was there, &amp; his assistant&#8211;curate </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lake</hi><hi> who lives with him. On the whole I was pleased with the appearance of things. Then we went on to Stockton, where in S. Peter's Church, I confirmed 42 persons. The confirmation was preceded by an abbreviated Evensong. The Vicar is a rather melancholy looking man named </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kirkham</hi><hi>, who was ordained in 1898 after taking his degree from Trinity College, Oxford. He has held his present position for 10 years, &amp; was at one time a missionary (S.P.G.) in Burmah. He calls himself an "Anglo&#8211;Catholick". He has more than 16,000 people in his parish, &amp; his benefice, which is in my gift, is said to be worth &#x00A3;434 net. There </hi><hi rend="underline">ought</hi><hi> to have been not less than 330 persons presented for Confirmation: there </hi><hi rend="underline">were</hi><hi> 42!</hi>
