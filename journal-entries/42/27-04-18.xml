<hi>The brilliant weather has continued. I had a 'heart to heart' talk with Ernest. He behaved well in rushing George Laws into Newcastle for an operation for appendicitis: and to that extent disarmed me: but I was insistent on the dies fatalis named in my letter. Thus my whole morning was frittered away.</hi>

<hi>The Park was crowded with holiday&#8211;makers, and presented a gay &amp; re&#8211;assuring aspect: for they enjoyed themselves and behaved very nicely. Golf, football, and hockey were played: and the multitude of children rolled down the grassy slopes in limitless glee. But the dirty paper and orange&#8211;peel would move to tears even the rebel angels themselves!</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Cardinal Bourne</hi><hi> appears to have repeated at York substantially the same sermon as that which he preached in Sunderland in 1924. He was even more offensive in his assertions. Perhaps foolishly &#8211; for what does it matter what he, or any other liar chooses to say &#8211; I wrote a short letter to the </hi><hi rend="underline">'Yorkshire Post'</hi><hi>, and sent the Editor a copy of my sermon on ''Continuity'', which I wrote in answer to the knave in 1924.</hi>
