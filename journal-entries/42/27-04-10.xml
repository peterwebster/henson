<hi>The clocks were changed last night, and we shivered on a cold morning as we hailed the advent of "summer time". On the whole, the gains of Day&#8211;light Saving probably outweigh the losses, but these are more considerable than enthusiasts care to realize.</hi>

<hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. In the course of the day I wrote to my brother Gilbert, and to George Nimmins. Also, I finished reading a very excellent book, '</hi><hi rend="underline">Christianity according to S Paul</hi><hi> by Anderson Scott. He reduces to its proper unimportance the alleged influence of the Pagan mysteries on the Apostle's thought.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>In the afternoon I went to South Church, &amp; there confirmed 143 persons from the parishes of Auckland S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Andrew and Coundon, of which the combined population is 23,732. More than 470 persons reached the age of 14 last year, but there are many Papists and Sectaries. Woods the curate of New Shildon came to tea after the service.</hi>

<hi>After dinner I had a </hi><hi rend="underline">dusty</hi><hi> search for the note&#8211;book in which my addresses on the Seven words from the Cross were outlined. I found them at last, &amp; lent them to Lionel, who is responsible for taking the 3 Hours Service on Good Friday at one of the churches in Gateshead. It is nearly a quarter of a century since I conducted that service myself.</hi>
