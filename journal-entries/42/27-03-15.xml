<hi>I wasted most part of the day in writing an Article for the "Evening Standard" on the Composite Book, which will make Bishop Knox and his friends very angry. This will not please me, for the old man wrote me a very kind letter in acknowledging a copy of my book. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The truth is that I am completely unintelligible to these honest fanaticks</hi><hi>!</hi>

<hi>Watson, the Rector of Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring, came to see me with reference to the letter I addressed to him yesterday. It was rather a painful interview.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>In the afternoon I walked in the Park. Lionel &amp; I motored to Hartlepool, where I confirmed 156 persons in S. Paul's Church. It was an impressive service.</hi>

<hi>"Especially I should like to mention the kindness &amp; help you offered me in one talk after dinner: it was a great help to me, &amp; I shall make every effort never to betray the spirit of it. The service &amp; the day as a whole was one which will live long in the memory of all who were present, &amp; I can never be too grateful for such an inspiring commencement to my work."</hi>
