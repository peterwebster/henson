The various functions arranged by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Cutts</hi><hi>, the Chaplain, with astonishing skill went through without hitch of any kind. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Londonderry</hi><hi> spoke excellently: &amp; there was a considerable gathering.
