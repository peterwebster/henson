<hi>The newspapers report Cardinal Bourne's visit to Furness Abbey yesterday very modestly, and give more prominence to the Archbishop of York's visit to Goodmanham. With inevitably mingled feelings I read that the Papists had to put up with a downpour of rain during their historico&#8211;religious functions, which, perhaps are as little serviceable to historical study as to religious life. To the local zealots, of course, they mainly appeal as methods of 'raising the wind'!</hi>

<hi>The Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> Ernest Augustus Merryweather, a giant of a stout man with a more good&#8211;humoured countenance than I had been led to expect, came to see me about the assistant curacy of Brandon, and, after some conversation, I decided to allow him to work there with my permission.</hi>

<hi>I motored to Barnard Castle, &amp; presided over a meeting of the Governors, then I spent an hour in the Bowes Museum. After this I went to Raby Castle where Lord Barnard was entertaining a party of 56 lads, who are starting for Australia. The mayors of Durham, Jarrow, &amp; Gateshead were there, &amp; divers others of both sexes. Every boy received a Bible and a knife. I made an address to them, was photographed, &amp; returned to Auckland.</hi>
