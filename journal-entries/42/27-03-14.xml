         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I wrote severely to Watson, the Rector of Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring, telling him that, in view of the large endowment of his benefice, he ought to pay &#x00A3;300 per annum with a house to a curate. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Also I wrote to old Canon Jones of Winlaton, requiring from him some explanation of the astounding fact that from his parish with 16,500 inhabitants no candidates were presented for Confirmation</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi>The old fellow ought to resign. He was ordained 51 years ago, and has been Rector of Winlaton for 43 years!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then I read through carefully the Article on "Erastianism" in Hastings's Encyclopaedia of Religion &amp; Ethics.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>In the afternoon Lionel &amp; I walked in the Park. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The Dean is reported to have spoken very foolishly about the Composite Book in the Cathedral yesterday</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> and I motored to Hartlepool where I confirmed 83 persons in Christ Church. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Poole</hi><hi> and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Prideaux</hi><hi> declared themselves well&#8211;pleased with the Composite Book</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Certainly the dissentients in this diocese are very few</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi>So far I have heard of none but Protestant "Die&#8211;Hards" viz:&#8211; Lillington, Bothamly, Drury, Clayton, &amp; Ferguson.</hi>
