<hi>My Dear Sir,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The regrettable death of Canon Cruickshank has vacated the Professorship of Greek in the University of Durham, to which is annexed a residentiary Canonry in Durham Cathedral. It is my duty as Bishop of Durham to appoint the new Professor, and I have much pleasure in proposing that you should undertake the combined office. The income of the professorship is provided by the endowment of the Canonry viz: £1000 per annum, together with a house in the College free from rates &amp; dilapidations. The duties of the Chair are prescribed by the University, and they are stated on the enclosed paper which has been placed in my hands. You will notice that mention is made of the Bonus which was paid to the late Professor, &amp; which "in the event of his successor being able to undertake the full obligation" the Council would "favourably regard" continuing. I may add that the amount of the said Bonus was £200.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[140]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>If you are disposed to consider accepting the Chair, I shall be pleased if you could visit me at your early convenience. Except for the 28</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, and 29</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> of June I l the 22</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> June until the 1</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi> July, when I must come to London until 9</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> July.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Believe me </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Yours very faithfully.</hi>

<hi rend="underline">Professor of Greek</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>At a meeting of the Council held yesterday, it was agreed:–</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>(a) that the professor of Greek be held liable to give up to 10 lectures a week at the discretion of the Council and to supervise advanced studies:</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>(b) that in the event of the professor being able to undertake the above full obligation, the Council would favourably regard the continuance of the Bonus paid to Professor Cruickshank and it was understood that the President &amp; Professor How, in pursuance of the Minute of 27</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> May, 1927., would now communicate the Council's decision to the Bishop of Durham.</hi>

<hi>I dispatched the foregoing letter to the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Reverend G. C. Richards</hi><hi rend="underline">, Oriel College, Oxford.</hi><hi> Yesterday I had some talk about him with the Bishops of Oxford and Gloucester, and, in spite of his relatively advanced age, and his Welsh origin, they counselled me to appoint him. I hope the appointment will turn out well.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I received the following telegram from Robin:– "many thanks kind letter will certainly write." He left England yesterday on some kind of official cruise to the Pacific.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>After writing to Ella, I breakfasted &amp; then walked to the Athenaeum, where I read the papers &amp; wrote my letters. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Then, in an excess of folly I wrote a letter to the Times headed Religion &amp; Politics, commenting on the paper which was sent to me a few days ago by "the League of the Kingdom of God", denouncing the trade Disputes Bill</hi><hi>. Probably the Editor will not think it worth publishing. I lunched in the Club, &amp; then encountered </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Buchan</hi><hi>, with whom I had some talk. I walked to the Ecclesiastical Commission, &amp; had speech with the assistant secretary about Boldon.</hi>
