<hi>I sent the bookseller a cheque for &#x00A3;60. being the price of the copy of Sir Thomas More's English Works. It will probably fetch as much when my books are sold, so that it not as extravagant a folly as may appear. Still, it </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">is</hi><hi> rather an absurd proceeding.</hi>

<hi>I made a start on an Address for next Sunday: &amp; then walked round the garden with Laws in order to see the damage wrought by the violent tempest of Tuesday last. Then I motored into Durham with Lionel, &amp; attended the High Sheriff's lunch. It was quite a pleasant party. The High Sheriff, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">General Surtees</hi><hi>, is fairly well&#8211;liked. I proposed his health in a speech which seemed to please everybody. Then I presided over a meeting of the Clergy Training &amp; Maintenance Board, and interviewed two Ordination Candidates in the Chapter Office. I had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Knight, &amp; returned to Auckland.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Nigel Cornwall</hi><hi>, the Oriel man who hopes to be ordained at Advent, &amp; to start work under the auspices M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> MacMunn, came to stay. I walked with him for an hour before dinner, &amp; found him a candid youth. He is the kind of Ordination candidate whom one saw forty years ago. Like the British infantry, it is the best in the world, but alas! there are so few of its kind! </hi><hi rend="underline">I told James that I would pay for the clothes needed for his going to sea</hi><hi>.</hi>
