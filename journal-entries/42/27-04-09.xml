<hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to the Editor of the Evening Standard asking him to correct his statement that I was the author of the Preface to the Revised Book. In spite of my clear disclaimer at the recent meeting of the Convocations, the newspapers will persist in crediting me with a dominating influence on the process of Revision.</hi>

<hi>I prepared notes for use in the afternoon, and paid a visit to Spedding. Lady Elibank arrived at lunch just as I was about to start for South Shields where I had undertaken to dedicate the new Headquarters of the Deaf and Dumb Association. We had some difficulty in getting through Sunderland, which was crowded with young men hasting to see a football match. The Institute was crowded with the supporters and beneficiaries of the Association. I gave a short address, which was translated to the latter by the fingers of the Chaplain. After the function, we returned to Auckland, arriving about 5.30 p.m. The wind was bitterly cold.</hi>
