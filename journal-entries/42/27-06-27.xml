<hi>I wrote an address for the Auckland Brotherhood, which in spite of myself took a very gloomy form, so gloomy that I felt myself compelled to add a short epilogue of optimistic platitude after the manner of the orthodox editor of </hi><hi rend="underline">Ecclesiastes</hi><hi>.</hi>

<hi>After lunch, I went to Durham, and preached to a great congregation of the Mothers' Union, which filled the nave and transepts of the Cathedral. There are to be two more such assemblies, the diocese being divided into 3 parts for the purpose of the annual service of the Union. I took for my text the familiar words of Christ, "</hi><hi rend="underline">Suffer the little children to come unto Me, etc.</hi><hi>", and took occasion to speak about the horrible attack which the Bolshevists are making on childhood.</hi>

<hi>The Dean of Norwich wrote to ask me to contribute to a fund for making a presentation to old Canon Hay Aitken, who is celebrating the "diamond jubilee" of his marriage. I sent a guinea, but smiled at myself for doing so: for why, in the name of all things reasonable, should we make gifts to a man for protracting his dotage beyond the usual duration? If mere longevity were the measure of merit our calendars would contain some odd saints!</hi>
