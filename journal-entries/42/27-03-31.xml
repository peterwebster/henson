<hi>I breakfasted with Londonderry and then took my departure. </hi><hi rend="bold">[</hi><hi>After visiting the hair&#8211;dresser, I walked to Sackville Street, &amp; ordered a holiday suit.</hi><hi rend="bold">]</hi><hi> I went in to the City and called at St. Pauls Deanery. Ralph was at home, and talked with me for nearly an hour. Then I went to the Athenaeum &amp; lunched. I walked to Westminster and called on Downing at the Ecclesiastical Commission's office, in order to find out whether I could hope for any assistance from the Commissioners in the matter of my dilapidations. He was ambiguous &amp; not very encouraging. However, I undertook to write to him formally on the subject. Then I attended Evensong in the Abbey Church, but came away before the Address by the junior Canon. There was but a small congregation. After tea and the club, I made my way through pouring rain to King's Cross, and returned to Darlington by the 5.30 p.m. express. Lionel &amp; Leng met me with the car, &amp; carried me to Auckland where I arrived about 10.45p.m.</hi>
