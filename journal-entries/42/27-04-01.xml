         <p>
<hi>I received a pleasant letter from L</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> Stamfordham.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>"As I told you, I had suggested to the King that he might read your article in the Evening Standard of the 29</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> instant. This morning his Majesty told me that both he and the Queen had read it with much interest &amp; satisfaction, &amp; thought it took a very fair view of the situation".</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>This is gratifying. The "Protestant Underworld" would rage against the throne if it knew his Majesty's mind!</hi>

<hi>Deryk Elliott,<persName xml:id="5627"></persName> a boy from Sedburgh, stayed here last night. An intelligent red–headed lad from Glasgow. He returned to school today. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I ordered an Austin 20 h.p. 6 cylinder car to cost £775 and to be delivered in July. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Also I offered South Westoe to the Rev. G. F. Froggatt, Vicar of St. Tomas, Sunderland. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Lionel and I motored to New Shildon, were I confirmed 133 persons. James went with us, but was unable to get entrance by reason of the crowd. Watts from Shildon was there with the candidates from his parish. I was civil to him, though he doesn't deserve civility: but he was not particularly responsive. His egotism is too morbid.</hi>
