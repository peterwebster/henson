<hi>Faith in democracy as a basis for government and society, once almost unanimously accepted in this country, now stands challenged openly and powerfully throughout the world because of the inefficiency of democratic governments â€¦ Only if the people of America make their democratic institutions efficient, can this nation ward off the absolute State as the basis of government and life, with consequent loss of individual liberties, as in the Soviet and Fascist experiments.</hi>

<hi>This is a pronouncement which sets one thinking, and the more 'furiously' since it comes from the most self&#8211;confident democracy of the world, which condescended to fight for no other reason than "</hi><hi rend="underline">to make the world safe for democracy</hi><hi>". The President names as one of the conspicuous evils of modern democracy "</hi><hi rend="underline">the abstention from voting of large percentages of the electorate</hi><hi>." Is this evil largely the result of the lowering of the franchise, and the multiplication of elections?</hi>

We discussed the probable successor, if Baldwin could not continue in office: &amp; were reluctantly driven to the conclusion that </hi><hi rend="i bold doubleunderline">Austin Chamberlain</hi><hi rend="italic"> was probably inevitable. </hi><hi rend="i bold doubleunderline">Churchill</hi><hi rend="italic"> ought to be Prime Minister if ability and achievement determined the appointment: but the country would not suffer it. </hi><hi rend="i bold doubleunderline">Colonel Headlam</hi><hi rend="italic"> spoke with energy against the folly of giving votes to the "flappers"; and said that doing so would probably lose him his seat.</hi>

<hi rend="i bold doubleunderline">Lady Thurlow</hi><hi rend="italic"> was very cheerful. She says that the Bishop of Liverpool would be preserved from many blunders if he had had some parochial experience.</hi>
