<hi>We left the Castle at 8.45 a.m., and motored to Barrow where we arrived about 12.30p.m. We lunched at the Victoria Park Hotel with the Bishop of Barrow–in–Furness (Pelham). With him were the Mayor &amp; Mayoress of Barrow. After lunch we proceeded in carriages to Furness Abbey, forming the rear of an immense procession of church–folks &amp; choirs. The Commemoration service was held in the field adjoining the ruins, which is an admirable natural theatre. There was an immense crowd, which was estimated (no doubt, absurdly) to exceed 20,000, but most certainly have reached 10,000 persons. 'Loud–speakers' made is possible for them all to hear: &amp; the B.B.C. carried my address over the nation. It was a most imposing &amp; successful function. Afterwards I went to the Rectory at Aldingham, in order to spend the week–end with the Bishop–Suffragan. The Bishop of Carlisle &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Williams &amp; the Bishop of Sodor &amp; Man were there also.</hi>
