         <p>Coombe Lodge, Coombe Lane, Wimbledon.</p>
         <p>Dec. 4. 1904</p>
         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName> has this morning requested me to write to you &amp; inform you that I do not sanction your renewed intimacy with him, and that it must cease. He also has given me a letter addressed by you to him a week ago, which seems to indicate that you are not aware, either of his position, or of my wishes.		</p>
         <p>The Churchwardens, at my request, have appointed him their clerk for one year, &amp; arranged for his instruction by the <persName xml:id="121">Organist</persName>. If he makes progress &amp; acts well, we shall encourage him to prepare himself for a musical career.  His <persName xml:id="327">father</persName> has accepted this arrangement, &amp; delegated to me, what is quite indispensable under all the circumstances, compete control of his acquaintances in Westminster.  You will therefore understand why I claim the right you seem to resent, &amp; you will perceive how much injury you might do his career if you incited him to disobey those who are both his employers, &amp; his best friends.</p>
         <p>Believe me, faithfully yrs</p>
         <p>H. Hensley Henson.				P.T.O.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>P.S. I have thought it well to send a copy of this letter to M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Knowling sen., &amp;, of course, a copy is kept for the use of the Churchwardens if, which I do not anticipate, I have to communicate further with you on this subject.</p>
         <p>H. H. H.</p></div>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I wrote this letter in consequence of a conversation with Harold, who ran after me &amp; poured out what was evidently a very full soul. I sent a copy to his father the same evening by his hand. The letter was marked private.</hi>
