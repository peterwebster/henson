         <p><hi>Miss Lawrie went away with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, to go together as far as Durham, where their ways parted. She going to Scotland, &amp; they to Gateshead. I wrote some necessary letters, and cleared up the disorder of my study.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>The papers report the melancholy &amp; mysterious fate of a Durham undergraduate, who was found </hi><hi rend="underline">decapitated</hi><hi> on the railway line quite near to Durham. He has been identified as young Ponsonby, whom his father<persName xml:id="5438"></persName>, a London clergyman, brought here to lunch last autumn.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>After lunch, in spite of falling rain, I walked round the Park.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">I motored to Newcastle, &amp; delivered my lecture on Tyndale at Armstrong College</hi><hi rend="italic">. There was a very small audience, unworthy of the subject, &amp; uncomplimentary to the lecturer. However they listened attentively, &amp; seemed to be interested. The Bishop of Newcastle &amp; M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs </hi><hi rend="italic">Wilde were present. After the lecture we &#8211; Ella &amp; Fearne having joined &#8211; dined with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Sir Thomas Oliver</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; his daughter. He was very interesting. We returned to Auckland after dinner, arriving at the Castle about 10.30 p.m. There was sufficient fog to render the chauffeur's task somewhat anxious.</hi></p>
