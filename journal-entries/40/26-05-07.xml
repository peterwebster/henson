         <p><hi rend="italic">A correspondent writes to ask whether something cannot be arranged for the idle pit&#8211;lads. It is a natural and very proper question: but there can be but one answer to it. Nothing effective can be done while the general strike continues. The mere attempt would certainly be imprudent, &amp; might easily be disastrous. If the pit&#8211;lads rallied to the notion of a meeting, their numbers would be formidable, and, in their present temper, the keeping any discipline would be great, &amp; might be excessive. The clergy would have no lay helpers, for every available layman is committed to some form of public service. Moreover, they have their own duties, which cannot be laid aside. I am engaged daily in confirmations, and, perhaps, these functions interest as many pit&#8211;lads as would be helped by lectures. Most probably, if any effort were made to organize classes, lectures, or even entertainments so few would attend that the effect would be negligible. The day has gone by for these well&#8211;meant essays in benevolent government. So I must needs decide, yet not without regret, and a certain sense of humiliation. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Bishop Palatine is as serviceable at this crisis as a post in his Park!</hi></p>

He speaks with enthusiasm of the Greek refugees from Asia Minor, who are "making good" in Greece. After lunch we returned to Auckland, stopping on the way to inquire after the health of Cook, the Vicar of Spennymoor, who has been near to death. He is still very ill, but thought to be facing towards recovery.</hi><hi rend="i bold">]</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The official report is fairly favourable. There is some violence by strikers in some places e.g. in Gateshead, Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street, &amp; Darlington in this diocese, but not very serious so far. In Parliament the Labour members are making themselves ridiculous by their protests against every step taken by the Government, especially against the issue of the British Gazette. The conspirators evidently counted much on having an unhindered course for whatever lies they chose to circulate; &amp; mainly they have only succeeded in alienating the press</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>

         <p><hi rend="italic">I motored to Kelloe, and there confirmed 125 persons in the little old church, which was crowded to the point of suffocation. Among the candidates was a constable in uniform. The singing of the congregation was remarkably good, a fact which expressed both the musical skill of the Vicar, D</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Short, &amp; his zeal in teaching the people. In the 7 confirmations, which I have held this week, </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I have confirmed more than 900 persons in parishes almost altogether peopled</hi><hi rend="italic"> by miners. This is of course far less than the size of the population requires, yet it is not altogether insignificant, &amp; suggests that the breach between the Church and the People is not so extreme as many would maintain. After the service I returned to Auckland.</hi></p>
