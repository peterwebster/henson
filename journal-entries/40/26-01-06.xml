         <p><hi>Monastic charity was heavily counterbalanced by monastic conservatism; but the reader will probably conclude with me, if his patience will follow me to the end, that there was a slight balance of prosperity, on the whole, in favour of the peasant on Church lands; such a balance, perhaps, as there is nowadays in favour of government service.</hi></p>

         <p><hi>This is the most favourable thing that this really learned author can say of the Medieval Church. It is not much, about as much, perhaps, as it would be true to say of a kind &amp; just secular lord as against the harsh normal type.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>We (Trotman, Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName>, &amp; I) left the Castle at 8:20a.m., and motored to York, when we arrived in 2 hours, the distance being 64 miles. I assisted and read the Gospel at the Consecration of Burroughs<persName xml:id="3777"></persName>, the Dean of Bristol, to be Bishop of Ripon. There was a great muster of Bishops, &amp; a fine service. After lunchtime at the Hotel in York, we returned to Auckland.</hi></p>
