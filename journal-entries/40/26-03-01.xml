         <p><hi>The "Manchester Guardian" reports that a small child, 4Â½ years old, was killed yesterday by the Bishop of Truro's<persName xml:id="2021"></persName> car. Frere was not himself in the car at the time. It appears that nothing could have saved the poor little thing who simply rushed straight into the car.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I finished the sermon for the sectaries, &amp; then received a parson, named Moore, who has just returned, after 5 years in the Colonies, to resume ministry in England. He will work at Lumley until May. I tried to learn from him some trustworthy information about Western Australia, where he had been working, but he told me little, &amp; that only in response to a fatiguing interrogation. My suspicion that Australia has no great future was confirmed.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Lionel &amp; I motored to Tynedock, where I confirmed 120 persons in S. Mary's Church. Save that 2 lighted candles were carried in procession, I was pleased with everything, especially with the candidates, who seemed very determined &amp; serious. Philip Strong<persName xml:id="5382"></persName> was there: he doesn't take up his new duties in Leeds until Easter Tuesday. We returned to Auckland after the service in the teeth of a hurricane.</hi></p>
