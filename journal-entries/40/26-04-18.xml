         <p><hi>Summer time began today: the clocks were put forward an hour last night. The morning was brilliant, mild and windless.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I left the Moss at 10a.m., and motored to the Castle, arriving at 6.25 p.m., after traversing 193 miles. The route lay through Falkirk, Edinburgh, Galashiels, Selkirk, Hawick, Otterbourne, and Newcastle. The roads were bad and winding on the Scottish side of the border: after leaving Edinburgh. They were excellent after we entered England. We lunched at a little hotel at Stow: and had tea at Otterbourne, thus expending a full hour: so that we took 7 hours 25 minutes to journey 193 miles, which works out at about 25 1/2 hours per mile</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi> This I judge to be good travelling, as we had to pass through some considerable towns. The weather was fine with interruptions of rain and hail. It was very cold. We met but few motors &amp; cycles, until we drew near Newcastle. As we approached Bishop Auckland two superb rainbows in quick succession illuminated our journey, &amp; carried their own distinctive message of spiritual comfort to my mind.</hi></p>
