         <p><hi>Still the mild, calm weather by the mercy of heaven. We did a good deal of mostly non&#8211;contentious work very amiably. My "literature Committee" presented its Report at the afternoon session, which was well&#8211;received. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi><persName xml:id="552"></persName><hi> drafted a prayer for "Universities &amp; other places of learning", and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Burroughs</hi><persName xml:id="3777"></persName><hi>, another for "All Seamen", and both were adopted without difficulty. Frere<persName xml:id="2021"></persName>, Swayne<persName xml:id="2909"></persName>, &amp; Woods alleged that they often met with cases of variation from the P.B. in the endings of the collects, the clergy adding the doxology at their will: but all the other bishops, including Ingram &amp; Garbett, denied ever having found that particular disorder. Indeed I doubt whether there are any such even in Truro and Winchester, though the matter may have been talked about. This is a good example of the random way in which statements are made in debate, which seem relevant and may be decisive, but which are none the less wholly or mainly untrue. After the afternoon session, five of us &#8211; Chester, Carlisle, Sheffield, S. Edmundsbury &amp; Ipswich, and myself &#8211; travelled to Farnham in order to spend the week&#8211;end with the Bishop of Winchester &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Wood. The Headmaster of Uppingham &amp; his wife were at the Castle. All very pleasant &amp; fraternal.</hi></p>
