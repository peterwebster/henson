         <p><hi>The weather has become bitterly cold, and a slight snowfall during the night has given a wintery aspect to the world.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Mainly the day was wasted, at least we had very little result of our labour to show at the end. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">We agreed to let the vexed question of "Corpus Christi" stand over</hi><hi> for the present, and turned our attention to the Calendar. Should provision be made for the observance of the "Black Letter" Days, of which the number is no less than 75 in the enlarged calendar? If so, what shall the provision be? These matters engaged us all the morning. In the afternoon we received a deputation from the House of Clergy. The Dean of Westminster, the Prolocutor of the Canterbury Lower House, Canon Robinson, the Warden of Keble, Canon Parsons, &amp; Chancellor Strawby attended, &amp; bore their testimony. I walked to the Anthenaum, &amp; was there interviewed by a person, named Milnes, who wants a living. I made short work with him. I received a letter from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Philip Strong</hi><persName xml:id="5382"></persName><hi>, announcing that he had accepted a benefice in the Ripon diocese, which had been offered to him by the Vicar of Leeds. He has only been 3 years in Orders, &amp; was quite of the most promising of the younger clergy in my diocese.</hi></p>
