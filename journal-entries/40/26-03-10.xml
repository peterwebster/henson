         <p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, March 10</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1926.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I went to Spedding at 11 a.m., accompanied (at his own suggestion) by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cecil M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cullagh</hi><hi>, and had the tooth extracted, which has caused me so much affliction, &amp; was no doubt a potent factor in my collapse on Sunday. The wretched thing was adorned at the root with a considerable abscess.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>During the last few days, a considerable number of letters had accumulated, </hi><hi rend="bold underline">partly about the division in the House of Lords, &amp; partly, about my indisposition</hi><hi>.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Forester</hi><hi rend="italic"> wrote to thank me for my assistance, &amp; added: "Also, if I may venture to do so, to congratulate you </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">on your magnificent speech, which I know turned many votes, &amp; caused others who had already half&#8211;pledged themselves to vote against us to abstain from voting. It was indeed a triumph, &amp; a triumph thanks to you</hi><hi rend="italic">".</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Bledisloe</hi><hi> writes that he was himself convinced by my speech that he "could not conscientiously support the Measure", &amp; adds: "I fancy that you must have converted several others besides myself, for the Lobbying </hi><hi rend="underline">in favour</hi><hi> of the Measure was far more intensive &amp; began much earlier than the canvassing on the other side".</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Sir John Cotterill</hi><hi rend="italic">, the Lord&#8211;lieutenant of Herefordshire, wrote a letter of thanks for my "very excellent speech" to </hi><hi rend="bold">[166]</hi><hi rend="italic"> which he also attributed great influence in the result. "The veiled (till this morning) hostility of the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">" has been a considerable difficulty to us, &amp; if it had not been for you &amp; one or two others, our case would have been hopeless."</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bishop of Norwich</hi><hi rend="italic"> wrote warmly of my speech: "So far as is proper &amp; seemly through the post I want to fall upon you &amp; embrace you in view of yesterday's victory which you won. It involved issues even more important than itself: &amp; no longer will it be the function of parliament to register the views of the C.A. &amp; E. Committee. Yours happily &amp; admiringly, B. Norwich."</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">I record these expressions of opinion as being strictly contemporary. They show clearly enough what the first impressions of the debate &amp; division were. It will be curious to see what the later opinions will be. Old Bishop </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Knox</hi><hi rend="italic"> sends me a "line of congratulation on your admirable speech" because he perceives in the rejection of the Shrewsbury Bishoprick Measure "an assertion of the right of Parl</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi><hi rend="italic"> to take its relation to the Church Assembly seriously", and adds, "the last point is most important". I expect that the Church Papers will contain some interesting extravagances on the whole subject.</hi></p>
