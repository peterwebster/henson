         <p><hi rend="bold">Sunday after Epiphany, January 10</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1926. Farnham Castle.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I received Holy Communion in the Chapel &#8211; a small building adorned with much wood carving of the later XVII</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century. At 11.a.m we had Mattins, &amp; that sufficed for the religious services of the day, our host going off to preach at Evensong in a country church. In the morning we sate and talked together. After lunch the Bishop took us for an excellent walk. The country was seen to </hi><hi rend="underline">great advantage</hi><hi> in the clear fine day. This is certainly a noble house, far more unspoiled than Auckland, and perhaps more commodious. The Hall, stair&#8211;case, and drawing room are notable, and the </hi><hi rend="underline">tout ensemble </hi><hi>of tiled roofs seen from the keep is unusually impressive. The Keep itself now includes a rose&#8211;garden. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Thorold</hi><hi> furnished </hi><hi rend="underline">Farnham Castle </hi><hi>for the benefit of his successors: but he stipulated in his will that, if the castle should cease to be used by the Bishops of Winchester, the furniture should revert to his family. This contingency is now near, &amp; the more unpleasant since </hi><hi rend="underline">the Thorold family is now Papist</hi><hi>. After tea I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, and then betook me to reading Coulton<persName xml:id="4746"></persName>, which becomes ever more interesting &amp; more disconcerting.</hi></p>
