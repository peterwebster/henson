         <p><hi>I had an interview with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Joseph M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Manners</hi><hi>, the lay&#8211;worker from Ferryhill, who aspired to be ordained. He has had no other education than that of the elementary school. He has been a miner; is 34 years old: is married &amp; has 3 children. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I finally undertook to accept him for Ordination if, at the end of 3 years, he could satisfy my examining chaplains: &amp; I exempted him from Latin &amp; Greek. I wrote to the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName> telling him what I had done, &amp; asking him to take M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">c</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Manners in hand</hi><hi>.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Lionel and I motored to </hi><hi rend="underline">S. Columba's, Southwick</hi><hi>, where I confirmed 76 persons. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">MacMunn</hi><hi> is an "Anglo&#8211;Catholick", but how far advanced I neither know nor care to learn. With the exception of six years at S. Francis, South Shields, 1911&#8211;17, his whole ministry since his Ordination in 1901 has been fulfilled in his present parish. I noticed that </hi><hi rend="underline">his</hi><hi> candidates were markedly younger than those from the other parishes. We returned to the Castle immediately after the service. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Quirk</hi><hi> arrived on a short visit. The weather has become bitterly cold.</hi></p>
