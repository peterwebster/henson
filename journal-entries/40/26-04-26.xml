         <p><hi>I left Brighton at 9.35 a.m. and had about two hours in London before leaving for Darlington at 1.15 p.m. In the Club I fell in with the Archbishop of Dublin, and had some talk with him. He spoke decisively of the unsatisfactory working of the system for appointing incumbents, which is operative in the Church of Ireland. He said that very rarely did it secure really good appointments. On arriving at Darlington Lionel met me with the car, and by 6.35 p.m. I was again at the Castle. I utilised my interval in London to visit my bookseller, &amp; there to obtain a book for James, who reaches the age of 17 today. Before going to bed, I wrote some cheques for bills that had come in, &amp; some necessary letters.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>The "</hi><hi rend="underline">Tablet</hi><hi>" has a paragraph on Headlam's<persName xml:id="552"></persName> attempted justification of his statement that Cardinal </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Gasquet</hi><hi> had advanced a claim to the possession of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Sophia on behalf of the R.C.

This statement the Cardinal "</hi><hi rend="underline">indignantly denies</hi><hi>", and the Jesuit </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Woodlock</hi><persName xml:id="5375"></persName><hi> challenges </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi><hi> either to substantiate or to withdraw.
