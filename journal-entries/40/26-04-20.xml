         <p><hi>I motored to Darlington, &amp; took the early train to King's Cross. On arriving, I went to the Athanaeum and deposited my bags. Then I went to the hair&#8211;dresser, and had my hair cut &amp;c. After this, I returned to the Club, where I fell in with divers of my friends who expressed much joy at seeing me again. I signed the proposal for Bell's election. Then I went to Victoria, &amp; took train for Brighton where I arrived at 5.41 p.m. Campbell was at the station to meet me. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Sir Oliver Lodge and his wife arrived at the same time</hi><hi>. Probably I caught a slight chill on the journey, for I felt distinctly unwell, and went off to bed as early as I could. In the train I read Burch's Article on the Slavonic version of Josephus, which appeared in the first issue of the new Liverpool Diocesan Review, &amp; has attracted considerable notice in the secular press. Also I read the letters which appeared in the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> from Eisler &amp; Reinach. The impression left on my mind is that Bishop David has been taken in by an inadequately trained scholar.</hi></p>
