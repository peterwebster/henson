         <p><hi rend="bold">Monday, March 15</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1926.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Major</hi><hi> wrote to say that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Macan</hi><hi> had told him that my sermon in the Abbey ought to be published, and asked that I would let him have it for the "</hi><hi rend="underline">Modern Churchman</hi><hi>". I sent him the MS.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I spent the morning in writing an article on "</hi><hi rend="underline">Parliament and the Church Assembly</hi><hi>" for the "</hi><hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi><hi>". I illustrated the failure of the Enabling Act by adducing the case of Bishop Auckland, where less than 70 persons attended the annual meeting for electing the Parochial Church Council, though there are 1741 registered electors, and 16,000 parishioners.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">J. G. Wilson</hi><persName xml:id="2748"></persName><hi> had tea with me. He says that the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName> did well in the Chair at the Conference. I received from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir William Collins</hi><hi> a pamphlet on "</hi><hi rend="underline">The debt of English Non&#8211;Conformity to Holland</hi><hi>". It had been originally contributed as an Article to a Dutch journal. I wrote to him, &amp; sent him the </hi><hi rend="underline">Bishoprick</hi><hi> and "</hi><hi rend="underline">Continuity</hi><hi>".</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Bishop</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Hornby</hi><hi>, a hefty&#8211;looking cleric, came to undertake my confirmations. He appears to have been a college&#8211;contemporary of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wilson's</hi><hi> at Oxford. The weather was fine &amp; almost warm.</hi></p>
