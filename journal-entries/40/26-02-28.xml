         <p><hi>A glorious morning, so glorious that one could not but indulge the delusion, that the winter was gone at last, and the spring already smiling on us. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the chapel at 8 a.m. After breakfast I walked in the garden for half an hour, before settling down to the preparation of a sermon for Eldon. When this was finished, I read the "Observer" in the garden for an hour: &amp; then wrote letters to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>. In the afternoon Lionel and I walked round the Park. The brilliant weather brought an unusual number of the people to "take the air". <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Eldon</hi><hi> where I preached for old Greenway at Evensong. The church was fairly filled, and the service was unquestionably congregational, for the singing was a delirium of laughing hyenas, but they meant well. My sermon, which dealt with the subject of the Sunday &#8211; Sexual Purity &#8211; was listened to with the kind of apprehensive attention which that subject can always secure. I think it probably is necessary to speak about it now &amp; again, but one is never sure whether one is not doing more harm than good. I was, of course, very careful, &amp; not at all "naked and unashamed", as the manner of some is. We returned to the Castle after the service.</hi></p>
