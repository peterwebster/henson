         <p><hi>At 7.45 a.m. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel, being the while half&#8211;crippled with lumbago!</hi></p>
         <p><hi>After breakfast I motored to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sunderland</hi><hi>, and preached in Bishopwearmouth Church on behalf of the local hospitals. There was by no means a large congregation, and there did not seem to be many of the "leading citizens" present. However, I was assured that more were present than usual, and that the offertory was above the average. After service the Rector and I called on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Raine</hi><persName xml:id="5371"></persName><hi>, the local M.P., to whom I expounded the case against the Shrewsbury Bishoprick Measure, &amp; urged him to oppose the said measure. After lunch I "cultivated" my lumbago on the sofa, and read a book. "</hi><hi rend="underline">Our parson goes to Paris"</hi><hi> (the translation of "</hi><hi rend="underline">Mon Cur&#x00E9; chez les Pauvres</hi><hi>" by Cl&#x00E9;ment Vautel, which is said to have caused sensation in France.) </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Thompson</hi><hi>, the other M.P. for Sunderland came to tea, and discussed the Shrewsbury Bpk Measure. I hope, rather than believe, that both these men will vote against the measure. Then I preached at Evensong in S. John's Church. The congregation, of the very poorest people, was attentive, and I formed the impression that good work was being done there, though of course, the teaching &amp; worship are extremely Anglo Catholick.</hi></p>
