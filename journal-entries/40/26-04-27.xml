         <p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, April 27</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1926.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I wrote a short letter to the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> on the subject of allowing Sunday games on ecclesiastical lands; I expressed my regret &amp; consternation at the recent decision of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and indicated my belief that when Parliament gave them control of Church lands, it did not intend also to clothe them with authority to give the Church direction on spiritual policy. On Nov: 23</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi><hi> 1925, I find that I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Lewis Dibbin</hi><hi> stating my objection to the permission of Sunday games. A copy of my letter was preserved.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi><persName xml:id="3572"></persName><hi> came to see me, &amp; we walked round the Park together. I wonder whether he will get through his examination.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Beyond writing a series of letters, &amp; having yet another interview with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Spedding</hi><hi>, I have done nothing today. The weather was heavy, and fostered whatever tendency to idleness was in me. My cold hangs about me, &amp; assists to the same end. When the Book will be written becomes more problematical every day, but meantime the hours slip past, and some d&#x00E9;nouement of humiliation draws on! </hi></p>
