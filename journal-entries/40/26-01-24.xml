         <p><hi>If any shall surmise that writings in this kind may occasion too much liberty, a thing that little needeth in this over&#8211;licentious age: I answer briefly: first, that it is unequal that for the looseness of some dissolute, the consciences of those that be godly disposed should be entangled and ensnared: and, secondly, that whosoever shall take no more liberty than by me is here given, shall be sure to keep within the bounds of Piety, of Sobriety, of Equity, and of Clarity: than which I know not what can be more required.</hi></p>

I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. After breakfast, I wrote to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and George Nimmins<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>. I was shown Beck's family by Ashton &#8211; six droll little fat creatures &#8211; while Beck wagged her tail with maternal pride. I remained reading in my study most of the day.</hi></p>
