         <p><hi>I spent much time in typing the Brighton Sermon which I wrote last week. It is rather "a thing of shreds and patches." Then I spent an hour with the dentist. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> came to lunch. He told me that the Editor of the Times had referred to him the letter of the four "Liberal" Oxonians who find the present subscription a bar to their Ordination: and that he had counselled the rejection of the document. I showed him what I myself had written to the Bishop of Liverpool and Streeter<persName xml:id="3230"></persName>. I gave him my copy of Scrivener's edition of Codex Bezoe. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since I bought it. Then I was sufficiently interested in textual criticism to desire to make myself acquainted with its method &amp; argument. Now the whole subject bores me dreadfully! Bishop Wood came to see me. He had never seen this house before, and was interested by it. I gave him a copy of my "notes on Spiritual Healing". </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi><persName xml:id="3572"></persName><hi> came to dinner.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I paid into the account of the Barrington Fund in the National &amp; Provincial Bank the sum of &#x00A3;300 sent to me by the Catholic &amp; Apostolic Church for the benefit of the poor clergy.</hi></p>
