         <p><hi>This year (1585) came forth the exposition of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Thomas Rogers</hi><hi> on the Articles of the Church of England, which at first met not with that welcome entertainment which seemed due to his endeavours; for besides the two extremes (papists and schismatics) highly enraged, many protestants of a middle temper were much offended thereat. Some conceived it presumption for any private minister to make himself the mouth of the church, to render her sense in matters of so high concernment: </hi><hi rend="underline">others were offended that his interpretation confined the charitable latitude formerly allowed in those Articles, the composers whereof, providently foreseeing that doctrinal differences w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="underline"> inevitably arise in so large a church as England was, even betwixt protestants agreeing in fundamentals of religion, purposely couched the Articles in general terms</hi><hi>, not that falsehood sh</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> take shelter under the covert thereof, but to include all such dissenters within the comprehensiveness of expressions.</hi></p>

         <p><hi>I motored to Leadgate, and formally opened the Church School which has been rebuilt after destruction by fire. The old Vicar, the Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> W. H. Coney, is clearly past his work. His memory is failing, his speech confused, and his manner suggestive of senility. The Vicarage had an aspect of dirty discomfort, which was confirmed by the appearance of two sluttish maids. I was not surprised to hear that practically nobody attends the church. F. Priestman was on the platform. I made a speech which was almost ridiculously too careful &amp; elaborate for the place &amp; occasion! The Rural Dean told me that Dick, whom I instituted recently to the charge of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Aidens. Annfield Plain. is gravely ill with influenza. This is the 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> clerical collapse before the onset of winter. After tea in the school room (a horribly democratic affair!) I returned to Auckland.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>A bundle of the little tract "Durham Castle" was sent me. It consists of my address, which was broadcast, and a number of illustrations. It will serve as a Christmas Card.</hi></p>
