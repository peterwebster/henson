         <p><hi>I had a bad restless night, &amp; felt indisposed all day. The weather &#8211; which became rather sultry, contributed.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Alfred Appleby</hi><hi> came to see me in the forenoon: a shrewd, hard, not unkindly little man, who ( I am told) organizes Conservative interests in these parts. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He was evidently in hearty agreement with the Mine&#8211;owners</hi><hi>. He would settle the coal&#8211;dispute in the old way &#8211; and suspects the Socialist sympathies of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Baldwin</hi><persName xml:id="4118"></persName><hi>! The Bishop of Newcastle, Archdeacon </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Blackett&#8211;Orr</hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Stephenson</hi><hi>, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi> came to see me during the afternoon.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>The papers published </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Baldwin's</hi><hi> replies to the miners and the mineowners respectively. He adopts a tone of severity to both, and states that the offer of an additional &#x00A3;3,000,000 as subsidy to facilitate the re&#8211;starting of the industry on an economic basis cannot remain "open" after the end of this month. So for the moment the deadlock is complete, &amp; the outlook is hopeless.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>A long list of road&#8211;accidents is reported. There are but few trains running, in order to economize coal, so </hi><hi rend="underline">everybody</hi><hi> is on the roads.</hi></p>
