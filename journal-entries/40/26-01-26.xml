         <p><hi>It is a sin for a man sometime not to recreate himself: it is not only a sin for him to do a less good when he might and should do a greater, but it is also a sin for him to be about something, though a better thing otherwise, when he is called to tend a meaner matter: as it is a sin for a servant to be reading on a good book, yea on the Bible itself, when he should be serving in his Master's supper.</hi></p>

         <p><hi>I frittered away the morning in writing letters &amp; paying bills, &amp; then, after an early lunch, motored to Middlesborough, and "opened" the Missionary Exhibition, which had been proceeding in the Town Hall. There was a considerable gathering of people. What a woefully squalid town Middlesborough is! &amp; how low &amp; surly the people look! The thought could not but force itself on my mind. Is it really worth while to make efforts in order to create in Asia &amp; Africa these fine products of Christian Civilization? I returned to Auckland after the function. The weather which had been fine degenerated as the day drew to its close, &amp; became blustering.</hi></p>
