         <p><hi>The Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName> was in good time, &amp; he, with Lionel &amp; myself, left the Castle at 8.15 a.m., &amp; motored to York, arriving at the Cathedral at 10.45 a.m. in spite of our being delayed by the bursting of a tyre not far from Croft. The Consecration of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Herbert Sidney Pelham</hi><hi>, Vicar of Barking, to be Bishop suffragan of Barrow&#8211;in&#8211;Furness was carried through with the reverence &amp; dignity, which are the customary characters of functions in York Cathedral. I read the Gospel, and the Bishop of Newcastle (who is really better in health) the Epistle. The Bishop designate was "presented" by the bishops of Chelmsford and Carlisle. After the service we lunched comfortably at the Railway Hotel, and then returned to the Castle, where we arrived at 4.30 p.m. The day was brilliantly fine, and we ventured to have the car open on our way home. Everything looked beautiful in the sunlight: lambs were frisking in the meadows, &amp;, had not the wind been keen, we might easily have imagined that the spring had actually arrived. I paid the quarterly stipends, and wrote some necessary letters, delegating to my suffragan the Confirmation at Mutron.</hi></p>
