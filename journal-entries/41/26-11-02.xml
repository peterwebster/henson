         <p>I left the Castle at 9 a.m., in a considerable blizzard, &amp; motored to Leeds via Piercebridge, Ripon, &amp; Harrogate. The distance is 72 miles. I arrived at 11.30 a.m. in time to hear the Presidential Address of the Bishop of Ripon to his Diocesan Conference, which gathered in the Church Institute. <hi rend="bold underline">I had undertaken to introduce the subject of Religious Education, and I did so in a speech of half&#8211;an&#8211;hour's duration, delivered from notes. It was listened to with patience, &amp; decently applauded at the close</hi>. I lunched in the Club hard by the place of meeting, as the Bishop's guest. Costley&#8211;White, the Headmaster of Westminster, arrived in time to address the Conference after lunch. I heard his speech, &amp; then came away. On the way home, I stopped in Ripon to have tea. About 6 p.m. I was back in my room, where I found awaiting me affectionate letters from Jimmie, William, and Spencer. Also a letter from the C. O. S. Secretary sending me a cheque for fifteen guineas on account of my Lock Memorial Lecture.</p>
