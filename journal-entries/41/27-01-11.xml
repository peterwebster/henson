<hi rend="bold">Tuesday, January 11</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I received from <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Arthur Hird</hi> a series of inquiries about the volume of Ordination addresses, which I answered forthwith. It is a foolish business, &amp;, beyond wasting no small amount of money, will do no good to anyone. Why, then, do I go on with it? If I could answer that question, I should have done something to explain the enigma of my own luckless &amp; preposterous individuality!</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to Lady Wimborne suggesting that the Duke should address himself directly to me.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I went in to Durham, and instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bidgood</hi> to the new parish of S. Luke, West Hartlepool, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Renwick</hi> to the Ecclesiastical District of Shiney Row. Then I lunched with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi>, and discussed diocesan business with him. I presided at a meeting of the Diocesan Conference Committee, and interviewed an Ordination candidate named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cross</hi>, an under&#8211;sized, unhealthy&#8211;looking youth who said that he was an Anglo&#8211;Catholick. However, as he has a degree, &amp; is well reported of, we must not reject him. <hi rend="doubleunderline">South</hi>'s brutal expression about the sectarian ministries â€“ <hi rend="italic underline">the offals of other professions</hi> often comes to my mind as I review the latest aspirants to Ordination! One sometimes makes mistakes. The least impressive&#8211;looking individuals are found to be the most spiritually effective. The combination of physical weakness &amp; moral strength takes high rank among the "Magnalia Dei" which are the glory and the enigma of history. I comforted the poor youth by reminding him that the great Athanasius was described by a contemporary as a "mannikin"!</p>
