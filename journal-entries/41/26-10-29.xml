         <p>Miss Haldane indicated quite plainly last night that she disliked and disapproved my writing in the <hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi>, but she seemed relieved when I told her that the money earned thereby was devoted to good works. <hi rend="bold">[</hi>She evidently thinks that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ralph</hi>'s motive in journalism is money&#8211;making. She said that a well&#8211;informed authority had judged his gains on the last book, "England", already to exceed &#x00A3;1000. There is probably an element of truth in this, for men's motives are ever mingled, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ralph</hi> does present that strange union of mystical exaltation and business capacity which is no unfamiliar phenomenon in the history of Religion. This blending of incompatibles may go along with, and in his case does certainly go along with, a genuinely sincere character, but it may not, &amp; then it is very repulsive indeed. But it is never pleasing and always disconcerting.<hi rend="bold">] </hi>Personally, I do not care for money, but I am very free&#8211;handed and self&#8211;indulgent, and want a good deal! My "commitments" on account of others are ever growing, &amp; I hate the thought of "letting down" anybody who has put faith in me. At this moment I am charged with undefined expenditures for the academic charges of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi>, and the school expences [sic] of <hi rend="doubleunderline">John</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gerald</hi> at Leatherhead. My earnings from the "<hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi>" just amount to these payments: and I could not meet them otherwise without risk of financial confusion. In these circumstances, will any just judge censor me for so much journalism?</p>

         <p>We worked away in conference until 4 p.m. and then I got away. The Archbishop and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Davidson pressed me to stay at Lambeth for the next session from Jan<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi> 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> to 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi>, when we hope to complete the work. There are, of course, conveniences in being actually on the spot, but there are also some disadvantages. On the balance, perhaps, the former depress the scale, &amp;, therefore, I accepted his Grace's proffer of hospitality. I caught the 5.30 p.m. express at King's Cross, &amp; travelled without incident to Darlington, where Leng &amp; Alexander met me with the car, &amp; brought me to the Castle about 11.50 p.m. I "deceived the road" by reading Galsworthy's new story â€“ <hi rend="underline">A Silver Spoon</hi>.</p>
         <p>Among the books awaiting my arrival were one from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Darling[,]</hi> "<hi rend="underline">A pensioner's Garden</hi>"; and another from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Lawrence</hi>, "<hi rend="underline">Memories of a happy Life</hi>". </p>
         <p>The "<hi rend="underline">Daily Telegraph</hi>" has a leader on my "<hi rend="underline">Lock Memorial Lecture</hi>" entitled "The Spirit of the Age", which was polite enough, but mainly dissentient. It says that my lecture "was cast in very much the same mould as some of the recent utterances of that more frequent publicist, the Dean of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's". This is true, but also unavoidable. The "<hi rend="underline">Scotsman</hi>" also was moved to have an article which was mildly critical. There can be no doubt that the public lusts for cheerful descriptions of its state, &amp; forecasts of its future: and these it certainly is not in my power to provide.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Turner, the surgeon, who dealt with me in May, sent me a type&#8211;written copy of a letter on the coal stoppage which he had received from a well&#8211;informed correspondent. </p>
         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Church Times</hi> has nothing more to say about my <hi rend="underline">Edinburgh Article</hi> than to accuse me of unsuitable references to Bishop Gore! My language about him was elaborately polite, and even eulogistic: but what will you? For one person who reads my Article, 1000 will read the C. T.!</p>
