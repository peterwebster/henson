         <p>It is now a general saying in Russia that a Communist is known not only by his leather jacket and spurs, not even only by his unendurable bullying attitude, but, above all, by his soured and embittered temper. "<hi rend="underline">As suspicious as a Communist</hi>" is the common expression.</p>

<hi rend="italic">"</hi><hi rend="italic underline">As suspicious as a Communist</hi><hi rend="italic">" may take its place beside the famous cry of the Pagans as reported by Tertullian, "</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">See, how these Christians love one another</hi><hi rend="italic">!" It casts a curious light on the amount of "fraternity" which indwells the vaunted "equality" of the Russian Revolutionaries.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I finished "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Bolshevist Russia</hi><hi rend="italic">". The description of the oppression of the "bourgeoisie" is painful reading. Bolshevism is a new religion, and its fanatical procedures are built on religious precedents. In the 20</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> century Russia presents the barbarous intolerance of the 13</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> and the cynical oppression of the 17</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic">. Education in that miserable country appears to be totally ruined. </hi>

<hi rend="italic">The newspapers report vehemently hostile pronouncements from Protestants. A very foolish "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">defence of Confession</hi><hi rend="italic">", which </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Frere</hi><hi rend="italic"> has published in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Truro Diocesan Gazete</hi><hi rend="italic">, will not tend to mollify them. He says that "it is his (the priest's) duty to do his very best to know that God 'has given unto them forgiveness of all their sins', and this can only be learnt accurately by "hearing their confessions". He is speaking of confirmation candidates.</hi>
