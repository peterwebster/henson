         </p>
         <p>I wrote a cheque for the half&#8211;year's rates, which have again increased substantially. The rates on Auckland Castle have risen from &#x00A3;227.14.2 in 1925 to &#x00A3;343.1.6 in 1926: an increase of no less than &#x00A3;115.17.2 in the year. This is the cost to me of feeding the miners. Then I sent copies of "<hi rend="underline">The Bishoprick</hi>" to Mitchell, Sir George King, Sir Edward Clarke, Sir Lewis Dibden and the Dean of Exeter. Then I sent back to M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Kitson Clark the typed MS. of a children's Christmas Play which she had sent me for criticism. </p>
         <p>I took the Chancellor &amp; Ernest into Durham, where we lunched in the Common room of the Castle. Sykes, Wynne&#8211;Willson, Shaddick, and Fuller lunched with us. Then we went to the Chapter House for the Diocesan Conference, which was fairly well attended. <hi rend="bold underline">I delivered a very brief Presidential Address</hi>, &amp; then Dowdall introduced a discussion on the Report of the Ecclesiastical Courts Commission. He spoke at excessive length, and was, I thought, extremely confused, prosy, and pompous. There was a short and mainly futile discussion, and then I summed up and dismissed the Assembly. Then I went to my rooms in the Castle, &amp; received a deputation from West Boldon, which urged the immediate formation of a new parish. I listened with politeness, and replied with caution. Then I "collected" Ernest and the Chancellor, and returned to Auckland. George Craik arrived for the week&#8211;end.</p>
