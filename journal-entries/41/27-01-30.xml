         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 7 communicants. Lionel and I motored to Washington, where the local Freemasons were holding a Church Parade. There was a full church, an attentive congregation, a hearty service, and a well&#8211;behaved choir of men and boys. On the whole, I was well&#8211;pleased. After lunching with Lomax and his mother in the fine old Rectory which has been sold in order to be replaced by a smaller house, we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">George Nimmins</hi>, &amp; sent him "<hi rend="underline">The Bishoprick</hi>". Copies were also sent to the following: –</p>

         <p>I wrote to congratulate <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jack Wynne&#8211;Willson</hi>, on the announcement of his engagement. He is an undergraduate at Trinity College, Oxford, &amp; is just 21! But we are in the 20<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century! Were the Papists right after all in making celibacy a rule for the clergy? The scandals have been terrible, but freedom to marry does not guarantee the Church against all scandal, and the practical conveniences of celibacy are beyond all question very great. Sex is too absorbing to be allowed a rivalry with Ministry. But dare we risk it?</p>

         <p>The following lines are attributed to the pen of the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Thomas Spedding on the sign of the "Horse and Lamb" over the gateway to the Temple: –</p>
         <p>As by the Templar's Holds you go</p>
         <p>The Horse and Lamb displayed</p>
         <p>In emblematic figures show </p>
         <p>The merits of their trade.</p>
         <p>Their clients may infer from these</p>
         <p>How just is their profession</p>
         <p>The Lamb – sets forth their innocence</p>
         <p>The Horse – their expedition.</p>
         <p>"Oh! happy people – happy Isle"</p>
         <p>May neighbouring nations say</p>
         <p>Where you get Justice without guile</p>
         <p>And Law without delay.</p>
         <p>The Answer</p>
         <p>Deluded men, these Holds forego</p>
         <p>Nor trust these cunning elves</p>
         <p>These artful emblems serve to show</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Clients</hi>, not themselves.</p>
         <p>'Tis ah! a trick, 'tis ah! a sham</p>
         <p>By which they mean to cheat you</p>
         <p>You'll find <hi rend="underline">yourselves</hi> the harmless Lamb</p>
         <p>And they – the Wolves that eat you.</p>
         <p>Nor let the dream of no delay</p>
         <p>To these dark courts misguide you</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">You</hi> are the Showy Horse – and they</p>
         <p>The Jockeys that will ride you.</p>
         <p>Spedding, the dentist, showed me this satire of his ancestor. He had a biting wit.</p>
