<hi rend="italic">The dissolution of the "Life &amp; Liberty" association ought not to go unchronicled. I half incline to make it the theme of an Article in the "Bishoprick". An obituary notice might, not unfitly, take its place in a review of the year. And therein might also be brought a criticism of Lacey's Apology for the Anglo&#8211;Catholicks, and an estimate of the prospects of Prayer Book Revision</hi>. Add the formidable statistics of Ordination for the year, and a reference to the ecclesiastical effects of the great "Stoppage", and we have materials for a substantial contribution. Some notice must be made of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sykes</hi>' <hi rend="underline">Life of Bishop Gibson</hi>.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 7 communicants.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon Maynard Smith</hi>, who is about to edit the Church Quarterly Review, wrote to ask me to write on Prayer Book Revision in the July issue of that journal. I replied civilly, but declining his request.</p>

<hi rend="italic">I started to read </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bishop Lawrence</hi><hi rend="italic">'s "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Memoirs of a happy life</hi><hi rend="italic">", which he sent me a short while ago, and became so interested that I finished it. A good man, well&#8211;endowed by nature, financially "well&#8211;off", fortunate in all the circumstances of life â€“ Lawrence took a cheerful view of the world.</hi>

         <p>I motored to Sunderland, had tea with Wynne&#8211;Willson, &amp; preached in the Venerable Bede's church. The return journey was hindered by fog, but we got home safely about 9.30 p.m.</p>
