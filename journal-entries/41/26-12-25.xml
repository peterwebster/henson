<hi rend="bold">Christmas Day, 1926.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A mild, damp morning, the very opposite of all that the weather&#8211;wise have prophesied. The communicants at 8 a.m. when I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel was [sic] 19: including beside myself the following males – Alexander, Leng, Ashton, George, Harry, and James. The ex&#8211;service men's band started to play as the service was ending. I spoke a few words to them, &amp; gave them a &#x00A3;. Then came the "division of the loot" at breakfast.</p>
         <p>I motored to South Church, where I preached to an attentive but very small congregation. The sermon, originally written for use in S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi>, Westminster on December 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, was from S. Luke ii, 12. "And this shall be a sign unto you. Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothers, lying in a manger." I celebrated the Holy Communion, when 46 persons communicated, of whom a number were quite young men.</p>
         <p>We all motored to Durham, and attended Evensong in the Cathedral. I sate in the Throne attended by Ernest and Lionel, but no music had been provided so my enjoyment of the anthem &amp; carols was lessened. Also, I noticed with surprise and regret that the "State Prayers" were omitted, an innovation of sinister promise. If the order of the Prayer Book be no more followed in the Cathedrals, what must we expect in the parish&#8211;churches? We had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Knight, who had gathered together a fair party. Then we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>After dinner I read aloud to Ella &amp; Fearne Milton's glorious "Ode on the Nativity". It grows more impressive with every recitation. How it contrasts with the hesitating &amp; dubious apologies for Christianity which now form the staple of books, pamphlets, &amp; sermons, &amp; argue less faith than misgiving in the authors' minds!</p>

         <p>I have written 14 articles for the Evening Standard this year: –</p>
         <p>[The articles here underlined brought letters of protest. H. H. H.]</p>
         <p>1. <hi rend="underline">Hideous Graveyards</hi>.</p>
         <p>2. A Tax on Betting.</p>
         <p>3. Fanaticism &amp; Childhood.</p>
         <p>4. Parliament and the Church Assembly.</p>
         <p>5. <hi rend="underline">Notes on Motoring &amp; Motorists</hi>.</p>
         <p>6. Spiritual Religion and the Church.</p>
         <p>7. Class&#8211;consciousness.</p>
         <p>8. Anglo&#8211;Catholicism.</p>
         <p>9. The Strength of Churches.</p>
         <p>10. <hi rend="underline">Pilgrimage, Ancient &amp; Modern</hi>.</p>
         <p>11. <hi rend="underline">Concerning Slogans</hi>.</p>
         <p>12. Is this the Moment?</p>
         <p>13. <hi rend="underline">The Problem of Sunday</hi>.</p>
         <p>14. Religious intolerance.</p>
         <p>How far have I gained, or lost, influence by writing in an evening paper? The money earned may be left out of count, for that is expended on public objects, and brings no gain to me: but influence is the thing that counts, and that is not so easy to measure. One's name becomes more widely known, and one's opinions get a greatly extended circulation: but one provokes criticism, and arouses resentment, &amp;, perhaps, loses dignity.</p>
