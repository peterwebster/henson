         <p>A mighty gale raged all night, and continued all the following day. I fear that much damage will have been worked on land and sea.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Norwood</hi> went off after breakfast. He asked me whether I would preach again in the City Temple: and I replied civilly but vaguely that if he sent me a formal request, it would certainly receive a favourable consideration.</p>
         <p>Ella &amp; I went in to Durham, &amp; attended a meeting of the Preventive and Rescue Association. The resignation of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Donaldson</hi>, after 3 months' experience, was reported and accepted. It is not a very creditable episode, but the causes are rather understood than acknowledged.</p>
         <p>Then we picked up the Dean of York &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Ford</hi>, and carried them to Auckland, where, after lunch, I took them over the house, and then sent them in the car to Brancepeth, where they were to spend the night. They had never seen the Castle before, and professed themselves much impressed by the beauty of the Chapel.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I received from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bishop Knox</hi><hi rend="italic"> an acknowledgment of a copy of "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">The Bishoprick</hi><hi rend="italic">". The old war&#8211;horse is clearly ready for the fray. The question is, What influence does he possess? With the older men, his co&#8211;octogenarians, probably a good deal, but hardly with anybody else, save of course the fanatical Kensit&#8211;folk, who are mainly Dissenters.</hi>
