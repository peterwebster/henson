         <p>["]In his (Paley's) lectures upon divinity, he took the view, maintained also in his "Moral Philosophy", that the Thirty&#8211;nine Articles were merely "articles of peace", inasmuch as they contained "about 240 distinct propositions, many of them inconsistent with each other". It was impossible to suppose that the imposers could expect any man to believe all . . . . . Paley was intimate with Jebb, but declined to join in the "Feather's" petition of 1772 for a relaxation of the terms of subscription, on the ground that "he could not afford to keep a conscience". He afterwards, however, wrote anonymously in defence of a pamphlet written in 1774 by bishop Law in favour of relaxation.["]</p>
