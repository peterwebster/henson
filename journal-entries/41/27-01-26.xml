         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>I sent copies of "The Bishoprick" to the following:</p>
         <p>1. Colonel Headlam.</p>
         <p>2. Rev. John Ellison.</p>
         <p>3. Sir Edward Clarke.</p>
         <p>4. Bishop Knox.</p>
         <p>5. James E. Anderson. W. M. Washington</p>
         <p>6. Lord Durham.</p>
         <p>7. Lord Londonderry.</p>
         <p>8. Hon. Oliver Stanley M. P.</p>
         <p>9. Leonard Ropner M. P.</p>
         <p>10. Rev. Norman Sykes.</p>
         <p>A wet, blustering day, infinitely disagreeable and very hostile to any form of useful activity.</p>
         <p>I sent back the corrected proofs to Hodder &amp; Stoughton. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miles</hi> telegraphed a request that I should officiate at his mother, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Thompson</hi>'s, funeral: but I felt bound to refuse, for I could only have done so with great difficulty. I supplemented my telegram by a letter of condolence.</p>
         <p>I motored in to Durham, &amp; presided at a meeting of the Bede College Committee, &amp; afterwards returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>I motored to Norton, and there dedicated an organ in S. Michael's Church, and preached a sermon. There was a large congregation, far larger than I expected on a night so boisterous. After the service we returned to Auckland. <hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Frank</hi> 
<hi rend="bold underline">came to see me, and said Goodbye, before going to his new place</hi>. I gave him a &#x00A3;. as a parting gift.</p>
