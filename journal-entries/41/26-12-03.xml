<hi rend="doubleunderline">Fawkes</hi> writes: "The Marlborough case is a real grief to the better part of Catholics. A prominent layman writes to me – 'it horrifies me. The defence is worse than the deed, for they are destroying marriage by way of denying divorce. What is their approval, what are their condemnations worth?' What amuses me is the cleverness with which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bourne</hi>, who is a very astute formalist, always leaves <hi rend="doubleunderline">Amigo</hi>, who is a very stupid pietist, in the soup. And it is one of the ironies of human things that the Church, which poses as the one Church which enforces the permanence of marriage, should introduce an element of uncertainty into every marriage actual or possible."</p>
         <p>I motored to Newcastle and presided at the meeting of the Governors of Barnard Castle School, and afterwards lunched with them at the Hotel. Then I walked into the town, &amp; left my two watches with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Reid</hi> for repair. Also, I went to the photographer <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bacon</hi>, &amp; was photographed. Then I motored to Benwell Tower, and had tea with M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Wild. She assured me that the Bishop, her husband, has benefitted so much by the new treatment – which appears to be what is now called osteopathy – that the idea of his resigning the see has been dismissed. The Bishop came in as I was about to leave, &amp; he did certainly seem more vigourous than he was. Then I returned to the Hotel, &amp; dined with the "Old Boys" of Barnard Castle School. I proposed the toast of the School, in a brief, fatuous speech. Burkitt came home with me. I reached the Castle about 11 p.m., after a futile but fatiguing day. These school functions bring home to me with special force my absenteeism from the normal experiences.</p>
