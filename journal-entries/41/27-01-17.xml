         <p>There was a white frost &amp; theatenings of a fog. We travelled from Farnham to Waterloo in a train filled with business men, and got into Lambeth in time for the session at 11 a.m. We agreed on the Measure, and started to debate <hi rend="bold underline">the vexed question of the regulations under which Reservation for the Sick should be authorised</hi>. The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Bristol</hi> moved, and I seconded, a resolution that these should be set out in the Rubrick. The general drift of the discussion was favourable, and the Members in charge were directed to bring up an amended rubrick.</p>
         <p>After tea the Literary Committee met in <hi rend="doubleunderline">Haigh</hi>'s room, and did its work. Then I walked to  Westminster, and dined with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi>. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi> was there, &amp; had an energetic discussion with me on Labour questions. He is a more extreme man than I supposed, professing an admiration even for the infamous Lenin.</p>
         <p>My article, "<hi rend="underline">Personal Habits &amp; Party Principles</hi>" appeared in the Evening Standard. </p>
