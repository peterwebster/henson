<hi rend="italic">I wasted this morning in writing an article for the Evening Standard, "Concerning Slogans", in which I commented on the following</hi>:</p>
         <p>"No Popery."</p>
         <p>"Beer &amp; Bible."</p>
         <p>"Life &amp; Liberty"</p>
         <p>"Classes &amp; Masses"</p>
         <p>"Three Acres and a Cow"</p>
         <p>"Not charity but justice."</p>
         <p>"When Adam delved &amp; Eve span, / Who was then a gentleman?"</p>
         <p>"The Bishops, Vicars, Curates, Parliament &amp; Kings / Not only evils are, but worthless things."</p>
         <p>"To each according to his needs, / From each according to his capacities."</p>
         <p>"Not a minute on the day, / Not a penny off the pay."</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi> from Annfield Plain came to dine and sleep. He gives an ill account of his unpleasant predecessor, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Talbot</hi>, who was apparently not merely a canting hypocrite, but a crudely dishonest man. Of his own work he speaks modestly and manfully. One district in his parish is locally known as "little Russia" on account of the advanced Communism of the miners who dwell there. But their children are baptised, &amp; Dick is received not unkindly when he visits them.</p>
