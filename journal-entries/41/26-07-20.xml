<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi> went off to London by the early train in order to attend the Royal Garden Party, and visit the shops. I spent most of the morning &amp; some of the afternoon in finishing the Hereford Sermon.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Hunter Blair</hi> and his daughter lunched here. They came in order that he might photograph such post&#8211;Reformation episcopal seals as are preserved in Auckland Castle. He is a recognized antiquarian, and has a considerable acquaintance with the Middle Ages. He expressed admiration for Coulton's books.</p>
         <p>Archdeacon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derry</hi> and Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dawson Walker</hi> came to tea, and stayed talking for some while. I lent the former 3 books viz. Houtin's <hi rend="underline">Une grande mystique</hi>, Allard's <hi rend="underline">La R&amp;#x00E9;volution et Religion</hi>, and the <hi rend="underline">Report of the Farnham Conference on Reservation</hi>. </p>
         <p>I sent a cheque for &#x00A3;15 to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gobat</hi>, the "Red" Vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> James's Darlington, who has been ill, and is impecunious. This money comes from the Offertories in the Chapel, i.e. mostly from me.</p>

There were no less than 10 bishops there, including two suffragans</hi><hi rend="italic"> (Kensington &amp; Woolwich). The diocesans were the following â€“ Lichfield, Winchester, Hereford, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Southwark, and Ripon. These are all "Socialists" except Hereford &amp; Ripon.</hi>
