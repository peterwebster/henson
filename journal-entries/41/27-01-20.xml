         <p>The weather became very cold, and there was something more than a suspicion of fog. After breakfast the Archbishop read through the letter I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Edward Clarke</hi> last November, and expressed his entire approval. His Grace expressed himself so emphatically on the value which he attached to my presence &amp; counsel, that I could not wholly disbelieve what he said!</p>
         <p>I travelled to Darlington by the 1.15 p.m. express from King's Cross. The train was full of Durham folk. At Darlington Lionel met me with the car. On arriving at the Castle I immediately dealt with the letters which had arrived during my absence, &amp; wrote a number of cheques. </p>
         <p>The Editor of the <hi rend="underline">Evening Standard</hi> sent me a book – "The Inquisition, from its Establishment to the Great Schism, by A. L. Maycock, with an Introduction by Father Ronald Knox" – and suggested that I might find it of sufficient interest to form the basis of an article. Roman Catholic writers can never be depended on when they handle any ecclesiastical subject: but, though the book be worthless, it may serve well enough for a text.</p>
