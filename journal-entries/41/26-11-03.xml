         <p>I made [a] start at a Presidential Address for next Saturday's Diocesan Conference. After lunch I walked in the Park with Ernest. The autumn colouring of the beaches [sic] is exquisite, &amp; showed to great advantage in the bright sun. Sir Henry Craik arrived in the course of the afternoon. He is fourscore, but still energetic though, perhaps, showing some signs of physical decline. Accompanied by Lionel, and picking up Wilson and Cecil in Durham, <hi rend="italic">I motored to Lumley, and there admitted the Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> R. W. M. Ellison to the perpetual curacy of the parish. The church was thronged, many being unable to gain entrance. After the service I had some talk with the churchwardens about this interminable stoppage. They assured me that there was no want in their district: that the children had more than they can eat in the schools: and that the men were weary of idleness, and would return to the pits at once if they dared. This accords with all that I hear from other places. We returned to Auckland after the service, arriving at the Castle about 9 p.m.</hi>
