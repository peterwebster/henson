         <p>Ella and I motored to Darlington, and caught the early train to King's Cross. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ropner &amp; her daughter, from Stockton shared our carriage. <hi rend="bold underline">We drove at once to the Deanery, Westminster</hi>, but I got out at the Athenaeum. After having my hair cut, I walked to Westminster with Pearce, and arrived before the proceedings began, as we did not begin before 3.10 p.m. The whole afternoon was wasted by a blocking motion of a communistically&#8211;minded parson, named Pack, who, to my surprise, mustered as many as 35 votes on the division. </p>

<hi rend="bold underline">Several bishops expressed their warm approval of my article on Sunday observance in the "Bishoprick". The Bishop of Chelmsford was emphatic in his agreement with my address to the Diocesan Conference on "Prayer Book Revision". </hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi> came to dinner, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Iremonger</hi>, the Editor of the Guardian. The latter is a man, for whom I have a cordial dislike, though he appears to be a friend of the Dean's. I was as cold to him as I could be without violating my duty to mine host! After dinner, the Dean carried us all into the Abbey Church, &amp; showed us the book (Ackermann's) which their Majesties &amp; the Royal Family presented! After the ladies had gone to bed, he and I had some talk together about the Abbey. He is evidently putting the minor canons in their places, &amp; restoring some discipline. The choir, which costs for the boys alone &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">3000</hi> per annum, is not justifying its cost, &amp; is, indeed, not worthy of the Church.</p>
