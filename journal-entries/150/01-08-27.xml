         <p>A bright day but uncomfortable &amp; boisterous. After breakfast I was shaved by the ladies: &amp; fetched my 'Pilot' &amp; a letter from Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName> from the Post. Then we visited a section of the National Museum, containing antiquities &amp; curiosity illustrative of Swedish life. About lunchtime the rain began, &amp; fell vehemently, so that there was nothing left to do but write letters. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Reichel lent me Ibsen's "A Doll's House" which I read through with interest. I wrote to Perkins &amp; Carissima. After dinner – the rain having now ceased – we strolled about the city for two hours. The scene is singularly beautiful. Nature retains her freedom while accepting the yoke of a great city. We ascended the great elevator, which commands a splendid bird's eye view of Stockholm, and were richly rewarded for our exertion. In the whole course of our stroll we met but two drunken men, &amp; they were sailors, probably ashore from some foreign ship.</p></body></text></TEI>
