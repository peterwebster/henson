         <p>Riechel &amp; I having arrived, &amp; secured breakfast, went exploring in the town. We went in the steam tram to Scheveningham, which seems to be a Dutch Ramsgate. There we had lunch. We saw the pictures in the Mauritshuis. The collection is not large but it contains much. Rembrandt's great picture representing Nicolaas Tulp engaged in explaining the anatomy of a corpse to a group of surgeons is a wonderful work: there are several other notable paintings by this master.</p>
         <p>Paul Potter's "Bull" is a fine picture.</p>
         <p>I became quite ill before the end of the day, so we decided to stay at the Hague. After a most miserable night I so far recovered as to proceed to Amsterdam.</p></body></text></TEI>
