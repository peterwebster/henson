         <p>We went to the Krasnapolsky Hotel &amp; had lunch. The afternoon was spent in the zoo: which is scarcely inferior to the London collection in point of beasts, and far superior in point of gardens. We also saw the <hi rend="underline">Oude Kerk</hi>, a large Gothic building, now surrendered to the Reformed Religion. There are some fine painted windows, &amp; some interesting monuments to divers Dutch Admirals. For the rest it is sufficiently disappointing. After dinner we strolled beside the canals &amp; looked at the steamers. On the whole this is a fine city, full of energy.</p>
