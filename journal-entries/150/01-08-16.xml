         <p>We visited the Zoo, &amp; had a very interesting morning. There is a fine collection of beasts &amp; birds, &amp;, as at Amsterdam, they are well seen in excellent gardens. We were specially impressed by a huge Asiatic Elephant; a fine tapir, the Hippopotamus, &amp; the birds of prey. In the afternoon we did little, as it rained, but before dinner we drove round the Alster. Then we girded ourselves for departure, &amp; left at 11 p.m. for Copenhagen. We got on the boat at Kiel about 1.30 a.m. and reached Kors”ßr at 7.30 a.m. after was generally described as a good passage.</p></body></text></TEI>
