         <p>Before getting up, I eased my conscience by writing a letter to Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName>. Then I adventured a cruise in the town in pursuit of a barber. A shave having restored me to self&#8211;respect, I was able to move on once more in company with my friends. The ferry at Elsinore was unusual; it took the train on board, &amp; carried the whole thing across in 20 minutes to a line on the Swedish shore. About 3 p.m. we got an excellent lunch at Hjalarstad [?]. I never saw a better&#8211;arranged feeding&#8211;halt, or better food. Shortly before 7 p.m. we arrived at Gothenberg, &amp; went to the <hi rend="underline">H&#x00F4;tel Egger</hi>. Before dinner we went to the Post Office: &amp; I recovered some letters, the first since leaving England. After dinner we listened for awhile to the band in certain gardens, adjacent to the H&#x00F4;tel. The air is fresh &amp; invigorating, but by no means either keen or cold. There was a fine sunset, &amp;, after that glory had faded from the sky, the deep, dark azure, pierced by innumerable stars was amazingly beautiful. My first impressions of Sweden are distinctly favourable: &amp; I like the aspect of the people.</p></body></text></TEI>
