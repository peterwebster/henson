         <p>I sat on deck &amp; was rewarded by a beautiful sunrise. Copenhagen was reached about 10.30 a.m. &amp; then I had the mortification of finding that my bag, which I had had registered at Hamburg, had not arrived. So I reached the Hotel not merely tired, but also in an evil temper. I was so sleepy that I could scarcely keep my eyes open during a drive which we took round the harbour &amp; about the city. However tea revived me a little, &amp; I purchased a 'Guy&#8211;Fawkes'&#8211;looking cloak to take the place of my lost overcoat. Then we went to the station &amp; heard with much alarm that nothing had yet been heard of my bag. After dining at a Restaurant, I wrote to Dick Rosser, and, that function completed, went to bed. This <hi rend="underline">Hotel Konung da Danmark</hi> is conveniently placed &amp; seems decently organised.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Copenhagen impresses me as a fine, open city, but destitute of the higher kinds of interest. It has no mediaeval churches: &amp; it has no great historic importance. There are no buildings of conspicuous merit, and there are, unfortunately, many new buildings of aggressive demerit</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I have not yet seen the collections.</p></body></text></TEI>
