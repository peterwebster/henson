         <p>Toothache during the night made me "a wreck" in the morning, but notwithstanding I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.</p>
         <p>I addressed the candidates on "The Preparation and Delivery of Sermons", and later I delivered to them in the Deanery Chapel the accustomed charge.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="62"></persName> carried me to Durham in his motor, and I put up for the night in my rooms at the Castle. At 4.15 p.m. I admitted Herbert to the new district of Easington Colliery, having first attended Evensong in the Cathedral. I sate behind the Font unobserved, and enjoyed the music. At 6 p.m. I witnessed the legal subscriptions of the candidates in the Chapter House, &amp; afterwards dined with the Bishop &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Knight.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Vicar of Frizinghall (Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> J. H. Warner) has written in his parish magazine about the Mission of Healing which Hickson<persName xml:id="5413"></persName> is to conduct in his parish on Oct. 13â€“15. His letter, reproduced in the "Yorkshire Post", gives me the impression of a sincere stupid enthusiastick man, who finds in the ardour of his own feelings a sufficient evidence of the Divine origin of his notions &amp; projects. He has evidently been considerably criticised.</hi></p>
