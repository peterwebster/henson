         <p>The papers contain short biographies of the Bishop of Zanzibar<persName xml:id="3469"></persName>, whose death in Africa has just been announced. He was, in my belief, a very good, unselfish Christian, with all a fanatick's sincerity and all a fanatick's injustice, but naturally entirely loveable. It was impossible not to feel his charm, even when one execrated his bigotry.</p>
         <p>I motored into Durham, and dedicated the new organ in little Bow Church, which is now used as the chapel of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's College. The little building was filled, mainly with students, who listened very attentively to my address. After the service I with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> had tea in the College, and I departed amid the cheers of the youth, and "For he is a jolly good fellow" sung on the door&#8211;step! We went on to the pompous great Training College over which Miss May presides. Here we had a second tea (!) and then returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wynne&#8211;Willson</hi><persName xml:id="4448"></persName> and his wife arrived to dine and sleep. They are both very vigourous and cheerful. The strong air of Sunderland evidently suits them: and they are pleased with the warmth of the welcome, which they have received. Their children are all doing well. Thus the constituents of terrestrial felicity are multiplying in their hands â€“ domestic happiness, public regard, congenial work.</p>
