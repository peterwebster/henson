         <p>I walked to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; glanced at the papers, of which one, the "Daily Express", had a column on the Dean's<persName xml:id="114"></persName> foolish tirade in the Cathedral on Mayor's Sunday. The Jesuit, Whitlocke, has him at great advantage. I fear that the good effect of the Sunderland sermon will have been quite destroyed.</p>
         <p>I walked to Westminster, &amp; attended the Assembly. After lunching in the Athenaeum, I went back to the Assembly which decided to postpone the debate on Patronage Proposals until the next session. So I came away, and after having tea in the club, walked to Park Lane &amp; called on the <persName xml:id="3465">Scarbroughs</persName><persName xml:id="3466"></persName>. I had some talk with his Lordship, and then walked back to Lambeth.</p>
         <p>The Dean of Windsor arrived after dinner, and I had some talk with him before turning in to bed. He spoke very freely of his brother&#8211;in&#8211;law, David, whom he called "the most dangerous man in England," &amp; held his appointment to Liverpool to be disastrous. He had inherited <hi>'f</hi>rom his German mother, and Welsh father' a double inheritance of sentiment, was impulsive, reckless, and in himself indubitably a Saint!! This is interesting. </p>
