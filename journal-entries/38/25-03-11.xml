         <p>In suggestion lies the secret of faith&#8211;healing. But it must be applied by the right person, and a physician may be able to influence one person and be powerless with another. The difficulty is to discover how it is to be applied and how its exercise is to be safeguarded. For it can work for evil as well as for good. Suggestion, of course, has its limitations, which are obvious enough. It varies in degree and also in nature. It is outside our province to discuss prayer from the theological point of view. But it is unquestionable that prayer, inspired by a living faith, is a force acting within the patient which places him in the most favourable condition for the stirring of the pool of hope that lies, still &amp; hidden it may be, in the depths of human nature.</p>

         <p>I motored to Bishop Middleham, &amp; there confirmed 58 persons. After having tea with Sykes<persName xml:id="3470"></persName> at Sedgefield, I went on to West Hartlepool, and, in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aidan's Church, confirmed 92 persons. Before the service the Vicar took me to a house, not far from the Church, where I confirmed a young woman in bed. The weather was most unpleasant, sleet, snow, and wind.</p>
