         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I motored to Darlington, and there took the early train to London. The morning was still, misty, and bitterly cold. We had the compartment to ourselves after York, and arrived at King's Cross well to time. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went on to Lambeth with the baggage, and I, after getting my hair cut, walked to Westminster, &amp; attended the meeting of the <hi rend="bold underline">National Assembly</hi>.</p>
         <p>Very little was done, though a great deal was said. After the meeting, I walked with the Abp. of York to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; had tea. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><persName xml:id="3581"></persName> was in the Club, &amp; poured out his woes. He finds Birmingham filled with Anglo&#8211;Catholicks of a virulent type, &amp; is plainly "up against" a very perplexing situation. I walked to Lambeth, &amp; got there in good time for dinner. <hi rend="bold underline">This was rather a cheerless function, for his Grace gives no time to his guests, &amp; while this arrangement may benefit their souls, it certainly does not enliven their conversation</hi>. After dinner, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Frere</hi><persName xml:id="2021"></persName> sang some songs to his own accompaniment on the piano. It is an odd thing that the cheerfullest member of the episcopate should be our only episcopal monk! <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Lewis Debdin</hi> told me that he was coming to think that Prayer Book Revision would "fizzle out".</p>
