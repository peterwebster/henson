         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> accompanied me in the car to Darlington, where I took the 10.34 a.m. train to Oxford. At Northallerton Rawson got into the carriage. He also was going up to All Souls for the Gaudy. We had much varied and interesting conversation on the way. He told me that he was secretary to Bolcker, Vaughan, &amp; C<hi rend="superscript underline">o</hi>, whose financial condition has been recently much discussed, but which, he assures me, is really quite sound. The Times contains a long account of the "reconstruction" of the firm.</p>
         <p>The Gaudy was fairly attended, and everybody was full of kindness, but the mood of reminiscence was heavy upon me, and I was swamped by memories and regrets. Lang in Hall sang the Mallard song with all his old excellence: and the speeches of the Sub&#8211;Warden (Egerton), and the deputy â€“ Lord Mallard (Malcolm) were unusually good. Edgeworth, replying for the professors, excelled himself. I was called on to answer for the quondams, and made an uncommonly foolish speech. I had some talk with Lionel Curtis &amp; Wilkinson. Talbot, now a Judge, looked remarkably fit. I grew tired in the smoking room, and skulked off to bed before midnight. Forty years has made a difference in one's capacity to enjoy Gaudies!</p>
