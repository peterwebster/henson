         <p>We motored to Durham in good time for the service in the Cathedral at 11.15 a.m. There was a great gathering of the clergy from the Archdeaconry of Durham, but more than half of them did not communicate. We have not had an "Anglo&#8211;Catholic" movement for nothing! This scrupulosity about fasting communion has completely submerged the corporate obligation. The music at the celebration was beautiful, and, indeed, the service was very devout. I delivered the charge from the throne, and was assured that everybody could hear me with ease. I had no time to deliver more than a third part of what I had written, and the effect was unpleasing. After the service we all adjourned to the Castle, and lunched in the great Hall.
