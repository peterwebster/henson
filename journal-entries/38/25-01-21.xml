         <p>What took place in the Asclepieia of Greece may be readily and safely conjectured from what takes place at Lourdes today. The names are changed and the place, but the underlying process is the same, the agency is the same, and the whole transaction starts from the same springs in our composite human nature. Enthusiasm is endemic, and a common faith grows in crowds whenever an adequate suggestion is forthcoming. The traditional piety of the people, stimulated by the apparitions and intensified by "mass&#8211;suggestion" is sufficient explanation of the cures that are effected.</p>
