         <p>Would it not be truer to say that the motto of Jewish Religion was 'God in Man', and that of the Christian Religion was 'God in <hi rend="underline">the</hi> Man'? The distinctive feature of Judaism was the prophetic doctrine that "<hi rend="underline">the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord</hi>": and the central revelation of Christianity is summed up in the declaration of the Johannine Christ, "<hi rend="underline">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father</hi>". But Martineau was misled by his association with Unitarianism.</p>

         <p>I wrote to my two Godâ€“sons, and to a shirking curate, Riding<persName xml:id="5421"></persName>, who withdraws his acceptance of Blackhall, because the church is hideous, and the parson's house unattractive! These are not heroic times, nor are our clergy heroes.</p>
