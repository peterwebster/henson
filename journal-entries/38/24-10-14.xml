The inevitable consequence of associating "mental healing" with Religion is that no limit can be placed to the healing claim. For the Divine power is infinite: &amp; Faith brings no lesser force into operation. The New Testament credits our Saviour with unlimited healing power and if it is </hi><hi rend="italic underline">His</hi><hi rend="italic"> ministry of healing which is now being revived, the attempt to distinguish between one kind of disease and another is disallowed.</hi></p>
