         <p>I spent the morning in writing letters. Among them was one to that tiresome fanatick, the Vicar of Elton, who is said to have introduced the service of Benediction into the parish church.</p>
         <p>Then, after an early lunch, I motored to Blackburn. We went by way of Ripon and Skipton, and were just 4 hours in travelling 113 miles. The weather was dull, damp, and depressing. Though we traversed very beautiful country, we could see little of the scenes through which we passed. Canon Sinker<persName xml:id="5415"></persName> received me with much cordiality. His son, John, a lanky lad of 18<hi>1/2</hi> was there. He aspires to go to Oxford next year, and in due course to be ordained. I wonder whether he will keep his purpose through the experiences of Oxford. The daughter, who has been keeping terms at Durham, was also there. She is a pretty girl, who desires to be a private secretary, preferably to a bishop! Sinker is obviously devoted to his bishop, Temple<persName xml:id="1173"></persName>, but not so devoted as to be blind to his limitations. He expressed doubt of the policy of "Copec", and regretted that the bishop ordained men whose age &amp; illiteracy might well be thought prohibitive.</p>
