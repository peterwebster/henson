         <p>I spent the morning in exploratory reading for the Address on "Spiritual Healing". The account of the miracles brought by the relics of S. Stephen, which S. Augustine gives in the De Civitate Dei is very illuminating. He offers his personal testimony as that of an eye&#8211;witness, and yet the relics could hardly have been genuine, so that the theory of spiritual healing requires us to believe that the Almighty sanctioned a pious fraud by extraordinary displays of power! The same may be said of the Miracles of Lourdes. After lunch I walked round the Park with the dogs, &amp; Davis. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> went to a "children's dance" at Benwell Tower, &amp; I "entertained" our guests in their absence!!!</p>
