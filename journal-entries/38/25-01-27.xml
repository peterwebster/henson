         <p>I received pleasant and cheerful letters from William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and Frank Berry.

He is a large jolly&#8211;looking farmer who was very civil &amp; conversational. He was born, he said, in 1869, and well remembered when the Gaunless was a trout&#8211;stream. I questioned him about the cattle which he lost last year through "foot and mouth" disease. On the whole, I gathered that he was not discontented with the compensation he received.</p>
