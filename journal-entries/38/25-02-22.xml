         <p>O Lord, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity are nothing worth: send thy holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts that most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before thee: Grant this for thine only Son, Jesus Christ's sake.</p>
         <p>Amen</p>

         <p>The outlook was wintry, for under a brilliant sun the country was white. I celebrated in the chapel at 8 a.m. After preparing notes for my sermon, I wrote to Robin<persName xml:id="4430"></persName> and made a copy of my letter. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I walked for an hour in the Park with the dogs; the fineness of the day had brought many Sunday walkers there.</p>
         <p>I turned to my Journal and found the entry which recorded the marriage of Harold<persName xml:id="113"></persName> and Elsie<persName xml:id="2056"></persName>. I married them at Tewin on December 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, 1911, and now?</p>
         <p>I motored to Stanley via Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street (24 miles) and preached at Evensong to a large congregation. The parish church, a mean building which accommodates 450 people, &amp; yet suffices for a parish of 18,000 (!) is cracked in all directions by the mining underneath. I returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
