         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Temple's</hi><persName xml:id="1173"></persName> address to the Manchester Diocesan Conference is reported at some length in the 'Manchester Guardian'. It is cautious, balancing, and non–committal, but he "keeps the door open", and, though he declares himself unable at present to authorize spiritual healing, he holds that "we have a duty in the matter", and that <hi rend="bold underline">we ought to be able to go one better than the Christian Scientists in the matter of physical healing</hi>. So, I do not think that <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Hickson</hi><persName xml:id="5413"></persName> need regard Manchester as a closed door.</p>
         <p>I wrote a short sermon for this afternoon.</p>
         <p>After lunch we all motored to Durham to attend the service of the Diocesan Preventive &amp; Rescue Association in the Cathedral. The congregation was mainly composed of the collectors of the Women's Offering, which amounted to £566. I preached the sermon which I had written earlier in the day. After service we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi><persName xml:id="3572"></persName> came to see me. He has been at home with a damaged leg. I wish he had been able to read for Orders. His present occupation is not very congruous with his real mind, and does not offer much prospect of a career. In this matter unfortunately I came rather too late on the scene, and he is now 22<hi>1/2</hi> years old.</p>
