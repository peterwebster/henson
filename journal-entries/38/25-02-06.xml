         <p>I had another pencil&#8211;written letter from Fawkes<persName xml:id="1082"></persName> who is still in the Nursing Home. "Bishop Knox came one day: very interesting. He says that if the Archbp. resigns, he will do his best to get the succession for Winchester – <hi rend="underline">how</hi> imbecile it all seems! &#8211; &amp; otherwise – Oxford, or <hi rend="underline">yourself</hi>". It is amusing enough for the Abp. won't resign, &amp; neither Knox nor Fawkes will have the smallest influence on appointments. Meanwhile time passes, &amp; my generation is passing with it.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to Lang, re&#8211;iterating my advice that he should have no part in the Anglo&#8211;Catholic Conference at Middlesborough</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p>
         <p>I read through Rivers's "Instinct &amp; the Unconscious". It is evidently a fine piece of work, but rather difficult reading for the plain man. He endorses Freud's theory, but repudiates his obsession with sex.</p>
         <p>The weather was brilliant.</p>
