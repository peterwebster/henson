         <p>I received a letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Charles Ballance</hi> saying that his wife had been very ill, and (hearing that I was in London) desired to see me. I telephoned that I would call tomorrow at 11 a.m. Then I went to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> and attended the Assembly. The Bishop of Winchester proposed a motion asking the Archbishops to nominate delegates to <hi rend="doubleunderline">S&#x00F6;derblom's</hi><persName xml:id="2166"></persName> conference in Stockholm this summer. I thought it needful to make a short speech indicating my misgiving as to this extension of "Copec", and insisting that the Church of England must not be committed to anything. The Bishop of Winchester gave some vague assurances, &amp; the matter passed. Then the discussion of Pensions was resumed. I lunched at the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; then walked to Lambeth, where the little Committee on the Thirty&#8211;nine Articles had arranged to meet. We sate from 2.30 p.m. to 6 p.m., &amp; did a good amount of work. Then I walked back to the Club, and dined there with Firth, who has retired from his Professorship at the age of 68. It almost startled me to discover that he was no older. The weather, which was wet &amp; blustering at the beginning of the day, was wet and warm at the finish â€“ most unseasonable and unwholesome.</p>
