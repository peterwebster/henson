         <p>I wasted the day in writing letters, visiting the dentist, reading the newspapers, walking in the Park with the dogs, and finally going to Leamside to dine with Pemberton<persName xml:id="2837"></persName> and Talbot. The calendar of crime at the Durham Assizes was not so rapidly disposed of as had been expected, in that Talbot's week&#8211;end at York had to be abandoned.</p>
         <p>Alexander<persName xml:id="5214"></persName> reports having received a letter from the butler under whom <hi rend="doubleunderline">John Scratcher</hi> has been working. The unhappy boy has "taken himself off" leaving a note to the footman asking that his clothes should be sent to his mother. The butler also says that John has latterly been staying out late, which may mean that he has been "getting with bad friends". John was a member of the Church Lads Brigade at Wellington, and it may well be the case that he has enlisted. It is a most distressing failure. Last March he left us in the usual course "to better himself". I never wrote a high recommendation to a lad with more confidence. Everyone here thought well of him. Yet we know now, that he had debauched one of the younger maids, and is (he is but 18<hi>1/2</hi> years old) the father of an illegitimate child! The whole matter is heart&#8211;breaking.</p>
