         <p>It is generally known that John of Salisbury debated more or less seriously the question "<hi rend="underline">Can an Archdeacon be saved</hi>?" but few know the earnest &amp; far more significant discussion in Caesarius of Heisterbach. He begins: "<hi rend="underline">A certain clerk at Paris pronounced a terrible judgement on Bishops a few years ago, saying "I can believe anything, but I cannot believe that any German Bishop can ever be saved</hi>:" and he goes on to quote Salimbene's Geoffroi de P&#x00E9;ronne as saying, "<hi rend="underline">The state of the Church is now come to such a pass that it is not worthy to be ruled but by Bishops doomed to damnation</hi>.</p>

         <p>I motored to Stanhope, &amp; confirmed 4 boys and 18 girls in the parish church. This petty number represented the Church's harvest from two parishes with a total population of nearly 6000 people! Both these parishes, moreover, are well&#8211;endowed, the one being worth &#x00A3;1600 per annum &amp; the other &#x00A3;1000: and neither is in my gift. I had tea with the Rector, and then returned to Auckland, displeased and perplexed. A dreadful mining catastrophe is announced from Newcastle. 38 men &amp; lads have perished.</p>
