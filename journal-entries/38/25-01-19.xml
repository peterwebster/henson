         <p>I believe it is true that any attempt to remove errors from the teaching of the Church of Rome is likely to be summarily checked, and therefore that she is greatly debarred from that best kind of reform â€“ reform from within. But I see no equal safeguard against adding to and exaggerating errors she holds already. It is acknowledged that the faith of the Church may be injured by subtraction. It seems to be practically ignored that the faith may also be injured by addition. Anything that seems like a move in the direction of Protestantism is promptly stopped; but the most extravagant statements in the opposite direction, though perhaps privately censored by the discreet, are not interfered with by authority.</p>

         <p>Substitute 'England' for 'Rome', and this statement will serve to describe very justly the situation within Anglicanism. I worked at "Spiritual Healing" all day, not very fruitfully: walked in the Park after lunch, &amp; wrote a few necessary letters. The papers report the death of old Samuel Storey, who celebrated his 85<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> birthday but a few days ago.</p>
