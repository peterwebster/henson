         <p>The lines of morality are not like the ideal lines of mathematics. They are broad and deep as well as long. They admit of exceptions: they demand modifications. These exceptions and modifications are not made by the process of logic, but by the rules of prudence. Prudence is not only the first in rank of the virtues political and moral, but she is the director, the regulator, the standard of them all. Metaphysics cannot live without definition; but Prudence is cautious how she defines.</p>

Perhaps if one can secure so much as that one's labour is not wholly vain. I sent my annual contribution of &#x00A3;20 to the parochial funds together with a letter to the Vicar. I received a brief letter from William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>. He seems to be settling down to South African life.</p>
