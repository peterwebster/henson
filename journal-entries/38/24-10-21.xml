         <p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, October 21</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1924.</hi></p>
         <p>The morning post brought me a rather more cheerful letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><persName xml:id="4501"></persName>, though he evidently regards his present employment with unabated dislike. Walter Smith accompanied me as far as Darlington where I took the early train to King's Cross. I travelled in the luxury of an unshared compartment, and beguiled the journey with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Frere's</hi> <hi rend="underline">History of Elizabeth's reign</hi>. It is certainly very unfortunate that the three volumes of the standard History of the Church of England, which cover the period from 1509 to 1714, should have been entrusted to three men who <hi rend="underline">loathe</hi> the Reformation â€“ <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gairdner</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Frere</hi>, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Hutton</hi>.</p>
         <p>I attended the meeting of the Ecclesiastical Courts Committee at the Church House: and then drove to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>. Here I found the Archbishop of Canterbury, and had some speech with him about the Bradford Mission. Then, through a pitiless deluge of rain, I drove to the Deanery. I dined quietly with Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> and Ralph<persName xml:id="427"></persName>, retiring early to bed as I was mortally tired.</p>
