         <p>"Illustrations of the Influence of the Mind upon the Body in Health and Disease designed to elucidate the Action of the Imagination" by Daniel Hack Tuke M.D. London. J. &amp; A. Churchill 1872.</p>
         <p>This book contains an immense amount of information. On the title page is the following quotation from John Hunter</p>
         <div type="quote">
         <p>"There is not a natural action in the Body, whether involuntary or voluntary, that may not be influenced by the peculiar state of the mind at the time".</p>

         <p>The newspapers have reports of my address to the Conference. In the "Times" it comes under "Ecclesiastical Intelligence". It is curious how often, even with the manuscript before them, reporters miss the point of one's argument.</p>
         <p>I motored to Darlington, and there confirmed about 100 candidates in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Cuthbert's Church. The mild weather kept everybody out of doors, with the result that the congregation at the Confirmation was unusually small. However the candidates were of the right age, and very attentive. I returned to the Castle after the service.</p>
