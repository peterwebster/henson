         <p>I despatched the MSS of the two sermons to Hugh Rees. After lunch I motored to Newcastle, &amp; had my hair cut. Then I went to Winlaton, and had an interview with Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jones</hi> with reference to the two men – Evans and Barry – whom he desires to engage as curates. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Barry</hi> is an ex&#8211;Papist. I returned by way of Annfield Plain and Lanchester. Barry writes at some length declining the offer of Christ Church, West Hartlepool.</p>

Before taking any share in a public appeal for funds, I desired to be accurately informed as the legal responsibility. As the Council had been at the pains of taking legal opinion on the point, I required that they would let me see the said opinion.</hi></p>
