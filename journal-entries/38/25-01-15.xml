         <p>N.B. No record of Wednesday was made through in advertence.</p>
         <p>This was a brilliant day from dawn to fall of night.</p>
         <p>The dancing party did not get back from Raby until after 4 a.m. Nevertheless all (save M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowe) were down to breakfast, though rather anaemic to look upon! I worked at the Spiritual Healing paper, and was lucky enough to light on an admirably relevant passage in Westcott's<persName xml:id="1047"></persName> "The Gospel of Life". I nearly forgot my engagement with the dentist. After lunch Major and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowe took their departure. Eric Dawson Walker, who had arrived overnight from the Ball, also went off. The only subject on which he expresses any interest is Psychology â€“ a subject which plays the dance with the half&#8211;educated! Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I motored in to Durham, and had tea with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> at his house. Then we all went on to Gateshead, where I collated Hutton to the Rectory of St James, vacant by the transference of Perry to Westgate. Stephenson, the Rural Dean, acted as the archdeacon's deputy in inducting the newly instituted Rector. After the service we returned to Auckland, dropping Wilson in Durham on the way.</p>
