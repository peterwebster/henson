         <p>Paganism made its last stand in the temples of Serapis and Asklepios, and their powers of resistance were due to the cures performed under their auspices in the name of the god. In this struggle for supremacy over the ancient deities, the followers of Christ met the pagans on their own ground and adopted their tactics. Temples were replaced by churches, where Christ was worshipped as the Benefactor, the Saviour, and the Healer of mankind. These became centres for health cures, wrought by Christ through some of His saints, whose personality varied according to the district, and miracles of healing were performed in such great numbers as to secure the popularity of the churches.</p>

         <p>I motored to Etherley, and there confirmed 77 persons. Copies of the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> edition of '<hi rend="underline">Quo tendimus</hi>?' reached me. Later, I motored to Willington, &amp; there confirmed 99 candidates from the three parishes of Willington, Sunnybrow, and Hunwick. There were 53 males and 46 females. Among the former was a brother of that hapless youth, John Scratches. It was a good service, &amp; did me good. I returned to the Castle afterwards.</p>
