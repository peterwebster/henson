         <p>Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I motored to Trimdon, picking up Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> on our way through Durham, and I instituted old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Davison to the vicarage. After tea at the vicarage, we motored to West Hartlepool, where I instituted Poole to the Vicarage of Christ Church. There was a considerable congregation.
