         <p>I worked at the Baxter sermon, which – if I could have a clear month for its production – would be a fair piece of work. As it is, it will be a worthless thing. I walked round the Park with the dogs. The fineness of the weather made the walk delightful. I picked up two young miners – Robert Wright &amp; Thomas Ayscough – both out of work. I took them into the Castle, &amp; shewed them the Chapel &amp;c. Thirty years ago nothing had pleased me better than to have been vicar of a mining parish, and had a chance of getting into touch with these fine youths. But now? I am 61, and a Bishop!</p>
         <p>Copies of the Charge arrived from the publishers; and as acknowledgements reached me from two persons, I may assume that copies have reached the bishops &amp; the diocesan clergy. I wonder what reception this production will have. It reads mildly enough.</p>
         <p>It is plain enough that the temperature is rising in the ecclesiastical world. A considerable deputation has gone to the Archbishop of Canterbury with Bishop Knox's petition signed by over 300,000 communicants: &amp; his Grace has returned the usual non&#8211;committal speech. The Anglo&#8211;Catholicks of Birmingham are "shewing fight" to their Bishop. Quo tendimus?</p>
