         <p>Polling day is wet and almost stormy. The electors are stated to number 18,811,000 (10,719,000 men &amp; 8,092,000 women) in England and Wales. The total for England alone is 17,520,000.</p>
         <p>The Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">H. S. Milner</hi> replies very promptly: and his letter is a reluctant undertaking not to use the Form "<hi rend="underline">Devotions to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament</hi>". This is hardly sufficient to satisfy my requirement, nor is it expressed in a manner that encourages optimism. Yet, such as it is, I must make the most of it.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with the dogs. Beck discovered and devoured a dead rabbit!</p>
         <p>Car≈ëe arrived, and proceeded at once to inspect the electrical light installation. He expressed but a moderate satisfaction with the work which, he indicated, would have been more efficiently and economically carried out if he himself had been in charge of it. He may be right, for I have a bad habit for doing everything in the most expensive way conceivable! Certainly I shall be making a free gift of at least &#x00A3;400 to my successor in the matter of fittings: and, if I hold the bishoprick for another 10 years, I shall have defrayed the entire cost i.e. &#x00A3;1246.</p>
