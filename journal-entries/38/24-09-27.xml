         <p>The sun, vast though it is relatively to our little world, falls into the group of dwarf stars. It is a large dwarf, certainly, but a dwarf nevertheless. So our Earth's status in the Stellar System proves to be that of a dwarf planet revolving round a dwarf star.</p>

         <p>I had some talk with two pit&#8211;lads this afternoon, aged respectively 19 and 21. Both asserted that there was gross ill&#8211;treatment of pit&#8211;poneys [sic] in the pits. They were worked for 3 shifts on end, &amp; brutally struck with pit&#8211;props. The first was due to the zeal for economy on the part of the Company, the last to the cruelty of the pit&#8211;boys urging exhausted beasts. This is bad hearing. The younger of these lads was about to exchange his present earnings of &#x00A3;2 weekly for a fortnightly wage of &#x00A3;25 in Illinois, U.S.A. There will be a steady drain of our best workmen to American on those terms. Indeed, it is already in progress.</p>
