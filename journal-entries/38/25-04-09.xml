         <p>I believe Shakespeare was not a whit more intelligible in his own day than he is now to an educated man, except for a few local allusions of no consequence. As I said, he is of no age  <hi>Ì¶</hi>  nor, I may add, of any religion, or party, or profession. The body and substance of his works came out of the unfathomable depths of his own oceanic mind: his observation and reading, which was considerable, supplied him with the drapery of his figures.</p>

Old <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Haldane</hi> celebrated her 100<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> year yesterday. Her picture appears in the newspapers with very flattering notices. </p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Ernest</hi><persName xml:id="2841"></persName> and I walked round the Park with the dogs about 5.30 p.m. Rain fell with considerable vehemence, an ill promise for tomorrow.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Storr</hi><persName xml:id="1899"></persName> sent me a note acknowledging the proof of my preface to the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> edition of "Quo tendimus"?, and expressing his approval of it.</p>
