         <p>I occupied myself all the morning in writing letters, and preparing my speeches. After lunch I motored to Darlington, and there distributed prizes to the boys of the Secondary School. There was a large attendance of parents. I made a speech on "The by&#8211;products of education," in the course of which I said many true and some unwise things. However everybody seemed to be pleased, &amp; I came away amid expressions of goodwill.</p>
         <p>The afternoon post brought me a letter from J.D. expressed in terms of romantic devotion. The writer, now a man of 23, retains the same childish love which filled him when a choirboy of 12. It is in its way rather wonderful, and, while it pleases, also humbles me.</p>
         <p>The "Times" reports some amazing acts of heroism in the rescue of miners in the flooded Welsh mine. Certainly we do not need War as a school of the highest courage. I took the cutting with me to Stockton, where <hi rend="bold underline">I addressed a meeting in advocacy of the League of Nations</hi>, and used it effectively. Mr Clynes Jun: was announced as second speaker, but he was announced to be suddenly indisposed. I was informed privately that he had arrived on the scene too drunk to be produced!</p>
