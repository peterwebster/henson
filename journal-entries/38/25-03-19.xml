         <p>Physiology, or the accurate examination of animated nature, has stepped in to correct, by its careful observations, the fancy flights of metaphysics. Without pretending to define the nature of the soul, or mind, or intellectual principle, whatever we may call it, recognising only that there is a something which secures identity under the constant flux of changing sensation and emotion, the wisest physiologists have endeavoured to trace the means through which this principle of sameness operates. They have ascertained that for every mental effort, for every emotion, there is a definite corresponding change in a certain substance in the brain. No thought of the mind but leaves its trace upon the body.</p>
