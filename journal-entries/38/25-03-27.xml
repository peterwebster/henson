         <p>We travelled in the print of olden wars.</p>
         <p>Yet all the land was green,</p>
         <p>And love we found and peace,</p>
         <p>Where fire and war had been.</p>
         <p>They pass and smile, the children of the sword â€“ </p>
         <p>No more the sword they wield;</p>
         <p>And O, how deep the corn</p>
         <p>Along the battlefield!</p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fawkes</hi><persName xml:id="1082"></persName> quotes these lines in his fine little notice of <hi rend="doubleunderline">von H&#x00FC;gel</hi> in 'The Modern Churchman'. Who is the author?<note xml:id="554" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>I wasted the morning in composing a sermon for the Broadcasters of Newcastle on Easter Day: but I seem to have lost the art of sermon&#8211;making. </p>
         <p>During the afternoon I motored into Newcastle, and had my Absalom&#8211;locks shorn. They had become intolerable! On my return Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> informed me that he had forgotten to enter in my note&#8211;book the Governors' Meeting at Barnard Castle. It is rather annoying, but he was so much perturbed &amp; distressed that I thought it right to make light of it. How to fill the parishes, &amp; meet emergencies of sickness, is becoming ever a more formidable problem.</p>
