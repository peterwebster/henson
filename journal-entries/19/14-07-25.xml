<hi rend="underline">The Miners' Demonstration</hi>.<note xml:id="188" n="1"></note> The weather was boisterous &amp; uncomfortable. Public speaking could hardly have been easy either for speakers or for listeners. As <persName xml:id="2782">Jim Larkin</persName> was one of the orators, this was, perhaps, the less to be regretted. <persName xml:id="1814">Mooreâ€“Ede</persName> &amp; his wife were early in Durham. At 2.30 p.m. he preached a very suitable sermon to a great concourse of miners. In the course of his sermon he quoted (as if they were quotable!) <persName xml:id="891">Ramsay Macdonald</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2404">Keir Hardie</persName>! However I was relieved that he made no socialistic explosions!

<hi rend="italic bold underline">The "Times" sends me <persName xml:id="3520">Mason's</persName> new book on "Episcopacy" to review. It has been produced for the benefit of the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> in the matter of Kikuyu. It is a catena of passages from Anglican divines mostly exalting the Episcopate: but he makes some illuminating admissions.</hi>
