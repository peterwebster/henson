The <persName xml:id="216">Gows</persName><persName xml:id="542"></persName> returned to town in the forenoon. <persName xml:id="1178" display="no">Clarence Stock</persName> and <persName xml:id="1314" display="no">Gabrielsson</persName> in the afternoon. <persName xml:id="2936">Boden</persName> came with us as far as Newcastle.

<hi rend="italic bold underline">I had an interview with <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>, and told him plainly that he had not dealt fairly by his colleagues when he preached on "Home Rule". He said he wouldn't repeat the offence.</hi>

I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; then went with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> to Newcastle, where we dined with <persName xml:id="3184">Canon Kempson</persName>, &amp; then attended a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="198">Bible Society</orgName>, where I presided, &amp; moved the adoption of the Report. It was a small meeting, mostly of parsons &amp; women. I spoke for an hour. Old Archdeacon Henderson accompanied us to the station. I gave him a copy of <ref xml:id="383">"The Road to Unity"</ref>. We returned to Durham by the express, &amp; arrived in the Deanery about 10.30 p.m.
