I worked at a sermon for Cardiff most part of the morning: attended Evensong in the Cathedral: and afterwards spent an hour &amp; a half at a tiresome meeting of the Theological Faculty. Then I came home to dinner, &amp; afterwards dictated letters for an hour to <persName xml:id="3446" display="no">Noel</persName>.

On Friday evening <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> and <persName xml:id="1178">Clarence Stock</persName> arrived. On Saturday morning I took Gow for a walk round the wood. The views of the Cathedral in the bright sunlight framed in autumnal colourings were glorious. At 1 p.m. there was a little service for the Diocesan Ringers' Association in the Cathedral. I gave an address to about 33 men, seated in the Choir stalls.
