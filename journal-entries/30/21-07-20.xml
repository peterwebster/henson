         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. The Rural Deans communicated. After breakfast we held a conference in the Library on the question of recruiting for the ministry. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> introduced the subject, and there was a brisk discussion. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I motored into Durham, and lunched with Col: Ritson<persName xml:id="3825"></persName> &amp; his wife<persName xml:id="3826"></persName>. After lunch we went to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Cuthbert's, where I dedicated War Memorials, and gave an address. The Mayor &amp; Corporation attended the service, which drew together a large congregation. We returned to Col. Ritson's House, where I was joined by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. We motored to Newcastle, and attended the Lord Mayor's Garden Party given in honour of the British Medical Association. The Lord Mayor insisted on showing me Jesmond Dene which is remarkably beautiful. We motored back to Durham, and there, in Canon Lillingston's<persName xml:id="3262"></persName> house, I met several representatives of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Catherine's Home, &amp; discussed the question of closing it. We then returned to Auckland, and arrived about 8.15 p.m. Brigstocke had arrived, and I had some talk with him. Sending him to Horden is undoubtedly a bold experiment, for he is a crank, and his health is dubious. But on the other hand, he has ability, and the power of winning the affection of working people. He is a Malburian and Keble man. We are not so rich in public school &amp; university men as to be ready lightly to lose those whom we possess.</p></body></text></TEI>
