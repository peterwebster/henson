         <p>I delivered a speech in the National Assembly in opposition to the proposal that &#x00A3;18,500 should be voted for the establishment of a test&#8211;school for Ordination Candidates. I was fairly listened to, and even applauded when I sate down: but the vote was carried none the less. Of the Bishops 10 were against, &amp; 16 for.</p>
         <p>I lunched with Lord<persName xml:id="2735"></persName> &amp; Lady Askwith &#8211; a dull performance. The afternoon's session was devoted to the Parochial Councils Bill, &amp; was marked by an offensively vulgar speech by a parson named Atkinson.</p>
         <p>I dined with the Royal Society of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> George in the Guild Hall, and proposed the toast of the Society. The Prince of Wales was to have presided, but failed to turn up, his place being taken by Lord Selborne<persName xml:id="311"></persName>. I sate between a dull taciturn man, the Lord Mayor, and a garrulous ancient, Admiral Fremantle<persName xml:id="2556"></persName>. The spectacle presented by the great Hall filled with guests was brilliant, &amp; a quaint touch was added by the men&#8211;at&#8211;arms, bowmen, etc. etc. who carried the "Roast Beef of Old England" round the Hall, while the company applauded.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The "Daily Telegraph", which published Harold Begbie's<persName xml:id="5310"></persName> precious interview with me, followed it up with a leader today. Lord Burnham<persName xml:id="4801"></persName>, the Editor, was at the Dinner, and proposed the health of the President, (the Prince of Wales). He is a fat little bustling Jew, who, however, seems willing to be friendly.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
