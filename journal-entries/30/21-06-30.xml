         <p>The results of the elections of Proctors for this diocese have been sent to me. They are illuminating, &amp;, so far as I can learn, typical. This diocese enjoys the reputation of being an Evangelical preserve: yet of the 6 seats five will be held by High Churchmen, and only 1 by an Evangelical. Both <persName xml:id="3688">Archdeacons</persName><persName xml:id="590"></persName> would be reckoned High Churchmen. The Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="2785"></persName> is a liberal Evangelical, and I myself am ecclesiastically an outcast! The following have been elected:</p>
         <p>Archdeaconry of Durham.	</p>
         <p>1. Moulsdale<persName xml:id="3159"></persName>.</p>
         <p>2. Brown.</p>
         <p>3. Gouldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>.</p>
         <p>4. Barker.</p>
         <p>Archdeaconry of Auckland.	</p>
         <p>5. Knowlden<persName xml:id="5439"></persName>.</p>
         <p>6. Cosgrave<persName xml:id="5313"></persName>.</p>
         <p>The edifying spectacle will be presented in the National Assembly of the Bishop of Durham being outvoted by his clergy!</p>
         <p>I motored to Durham after lunch, and distributed prizes at the Speech Day of Durham School. There was a large attendance of parents. I made a speech. Fearon<persName xml:id="691"></persName> was there, &amp; made a very happy speech. Later I dined with the Old Dunelmians, when Fearon presided. It was not a very exciting party, but there was a good spirit in it, &amp; everybody meant well. William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> was waiting; and brought me back to Auckland shortly after 11 p.m. </p>

         <p>The Epilogue recited yesterday at the Speech Day made reference my return to Durham very civilly.</p>
