         <p>Dear M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dismoor,</p>
         <p>Thank you for your letter. Your proposed form of bequest appears to me quite clear. The only alteration I would suggest is the addition of Durham to the list of Universities. Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham are the only Universities with endowed Theological Faculties. If you made a bequest to the Diocesan Fund of any specified Diocese or Dioceses in the terms you suggest, I cannot imagine that any ambiguity could attach to its interpretation</p>
         <p>I looked at the Jesuit's book about Ireland: it is indeed, lamentable rubbish. It reminds me of those ill Christians of whom S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul says that "their glory is in their shame". To find in Ireland a cause for pride argues a strangely perverted standard of moral &amp; spiritual achievement. This queer sentimentalism, which reverses history &amp; turns morality upside down, is the bane of dish politics.</p>
         <p>Believe me. Sincerely yours.</p>
         <p>Herbert Dunelm:</p>
         <p>P.S. Yes: in the present circumstances of the Church of England I do think that you would do <hi rend="underline">most</hi> good by assisting the sound training of theological students.</p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Muir Mackenzie</hi> writes to say that the Ecclesiastical Committee has decided that the Parochial Church Council (Further Powers) Measure must not pass in its present form. This display of activity on the part of "the State" ought to have a wholesome effect on "the Church"! It is not without amusement that I observe the Angloâ€“Catholicks" being rescued from the "laity" in the "National Assembly" by the action of the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Privy Council.</p>
         <p>Blackwall having accepted S. Cuthbert's, I wrote to Francis of New Shildon offering him Middleton S. George.</p>
         <p>The Dean of Windsor writes to "find out whether I can come &amp; preach in the private chapel on either April 2 or Aril 23". I replied that I could do so on the earlier date.</p>
         <p>The Dean of Westminster<persName xml:id="325"></persName> writes to ask me to preach in the Abbey on June 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>: but I had to decline as I am already pledged to preach in S. Mary's, Oxford, on that day.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Curzon's<persName xml:id="1018"></persName> reply to Montague's gross attack was crushing, and gave him a great personal triumph</hi>. But the unavoidable publication of his 'private' letter is a great pubic calamity. I am almost tempted to think that the worthless Jew deliberately aimed at compelling the publication in order still further to inflame Indian feeling, &amp; precipitate a crisis. I wrote to congratulate Curzon.</p>

         <p>My dear Curzon.</p>
         <p>I could not get to the House last night to hear your statement, &amp; to congratulate you on as dignified and complete an answer to an outrageous attack by an unspeakable politician that I can imagine.</p>
         <p>But patriotism must have run very low in the channel of your late colleague's mind before he could have done what he has done, or said what he has said.</p>
         <p>A melancholy suspicion begins to grow and fix itself in my mind that the British Empire is breaking up. May Heaven grant that my fears be as baseless as they are distressing!</p>
         <p>I hear with concern that you are not well. The burdens are enough to crush most men: it is intolerable that there should be added the gratuitous worries of Montague's folly and baseness. But you have a great heart, &amp; will bear up.</p>
         <p>Always affect<hi rend="superscript underline">ly</hi> yours,</p>
