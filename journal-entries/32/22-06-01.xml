         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>Two years ago, on this day, I received the Prime Minister's proposal that I should become Bishop of Durham. That year 1920 was something of an <hi rend="underline">annus mirabilis</hi> in my life. The Lambeth Conference &amp; the visit to Sweden, followed by the unforgettable service in Durham Cathedral on October 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, must always give it exceptional importance in my life. <hi rend="bold underline">My episcopate started under the heavy shadow of obstinate &amp; protracted economic strife, and even now nothing can be truly described as normal.</hi></p>
         <p>The young thrushes have taken wing. These had gone before chapelâ€“service at 8.45 a.m., and the last took flight in the course of the morning. That they should have been successfully reared in such a place is a subject of legitimate satisfaction to a bird lover.</p>
         <p>Canon Jones, an old canting Irishman, came to see me with reference to his absurd curate, &amp; stayed to lunch.</p>
         <p>After lunch, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; I motored to Wolsingham, where I confirmed 49 candidates. After tea at the Rectory, we motored to Crook, where I confirmed 122 candidates. Then we returned to the Castle, where we arrived about 8.45 p.m.</p>

         <p>The poisoning scoundrel Armstrong was hanged yesterday, leaving the world something less depraved by his departure. This, &amp; Bottomley's conviction, are morally bracing events.</p>
