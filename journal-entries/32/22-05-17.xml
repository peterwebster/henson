         <p>A hot night followed by a wet morning. After breakfast I walked to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> and read the papers.

Headlam<persName xml:id="552"></persName> joined me at the Club, and we drove together to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> for the meeting of the Church Property Committee. Lord Cave presided, and the Session lasted, with an interval for lunch from 10.45 a.m. to 5.45 p.m. We occupied the time in hearing the evidence of 4 bishops â€“ Gloucester, Carlisle, Worcester, and Manchester.

Afterwards I went to the Athenaeum, and wrote to <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> before dinner. The weather continued very warm.
