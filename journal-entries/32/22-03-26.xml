         <div type="quote">
         <p>Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil deeds do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully be relieved; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

         <p>Is this prayer fairly described as a petition that the almighty may be more kind than just towards us? I cannot think so. Rather we pray that, in sustaining the ill consequences of our transgressions, we may be genuinely pertinent and that as penitent we may receive the "comfort" of God's grace in forgiveness. The frank acknowledgment of our demerits is not an appeal for escape from punishment, but a prayer that we may not be outcast from God's life.

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the chapel at 8a.m. The advent of 'summer time' brought us to our duties an hour earlier than usual. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, and four of the household communicated. We all motored into Durham, and lunched with the Vauxes at Dryburn. Then Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; I went on to Sunderland. We were held up by the bursting of a tyre shortly after leaving Chester le Street, &amp; arrived at St Pauls a few minutes after time. I confirmed 166 candidates: &amp; then went to St Barnabus &amp; preached to a full church. </p>
