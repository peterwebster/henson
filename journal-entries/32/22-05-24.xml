         <p>The heat today has been tropical. I spent the morning in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, where I had some conversation with Bayley<persName xml:id="2806"></persName> about the Committee. Canon Bickerstath from Canterbury talked with me about the state of Ireland. HE had just returned from Cork; his account of the situation of the Southern Protestants was woeful. They complain with well justified bitterness that England first disarmed, and then deserted them: that they are in worse case than if they were living in a foreign country: that their position is utterly desperate. The latest phase of our dealings with Ireland is the most inept, the most shameful, and the most disastrous.</p>
         <p>After lunching in the Club, I walked to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, and spent the afternoon at Lord Cave's Committee. The Dean<persName xml:id="114"></persName>, Cruickshank<persName xml:id="1898"></persName>, and Bayley gave evidence about Durham Cathedral. The first was fatuous beyond words, but I think he made no good impression. It is sufficiently evident that Dibdin<persName xml:id="909"></persName> is opposed to my scheme. Most of the rest are, I incline to believe, friendly.</p>
         <p>I walked back to the Athenaeum, and wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. Sir Henry Newbolt joined me at dinner. On returning to Park Lane, I found a telegram from William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>:&#8211; 'Arrived safely with car.' This is comforting. </p>
