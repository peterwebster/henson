         <p>Sweet are the uses of adversity, which like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head; and this our life exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything. I would not change it. </p>

         <p>The 'Steering Cross Rod Arms' arrived by post, &amp; William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> fixed them on the car, and after working until 4 p.m., announced that he could face tomorrow's engagements. His labour ought in equity to be paid for by the road authority: but the world is nowise governed equitably. </p>
         <p>I wrote a sermon for the Mothers' Union<orgName xml:id="220"></orgName>, and delivered it in St Anne's<placeName xml:id="104"></placeName> at 3 p.m. The women filled the church, and were attentive enough. So far I appear to have confirmed 2096 persons during March. Most of the confirmations have pleased me. The clergy have given me the impression of being glad to receive me, the candidates have been attentive &amp; reverent in their demeanour, and the congregations have been large and interested. <hi rend="bold underline">The only exceptions have been the few Angloâ€“Catholic centres, where almost the reverse of all this would perhaps be true. The candidates are not, indeed, irreverent: but they have evidently been warned against "false apostles"</hi>. </p>
