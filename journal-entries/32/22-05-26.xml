         <p>I spent the morning in writing the sermon for the Bede College Students. After lunch Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; I motored to Haswell, where I confirmed 86 candidates. After service I had tea with the Vicar &amp; his wife. The Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> George Sharp Skene is the son of a clergyman, &amp; one of seven brethren all clergymen. This must be unusual in these days of small families &amp; no Ordination candidates. He gave an ill account of the elementary school teachers, both male &amp; female. They are anti&#8211;religious, &amp;, in many cases, haunt the public houses. He thinks the plan which the Durham C.C. adopts, of placing the school&#8211;teachers in the districts where thy have lived, has an ill effect. They carry no proper influence, and fall into the current fashions.</p>
         <p>We went on to Easington, where I confirmed 156 candidates. The parish church, dedicated to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Mary, is nobly placed, &amp; is a fine church. It contains some 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century bench&#8211;ends, &amp; two interesting recumbent figures. The old Rectory, which is said to contain some 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century work, has been sold, &amp; the parson now resides in a rather mean modern house. We returned to Auckland by way of Coxhoe &amp; Spennymoor, arriving about 9.30 p.m. After supper I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName>, though it was rather like making bricks without straw to fill two sheets with the materials provided by my experiences of today.</p>
