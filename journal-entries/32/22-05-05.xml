         <p>Macdonald<persName xml:id="3698"></persName> tells me that the foolish curate from Boldon, who became a Papist, is now wary of papistry, and desires to return to Anglican chaos! But he must seek an open door elsewhere than in the diocese of Durham.</p>
         <p>Temple<persName xml:id="1173"></persName> writes to ask me to write an article on "The Incarnation and Theological Development", or something of that sort, for 'The Pilgrim'. I hardly think it w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be prudent for me to advance before the religious world as a champion of orthodoxy just yet!!</p>
         <p>An open car was sent from Heworth to fetch me to the Centenary celebration: Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> accompanied me. We went first to the House of an excellent mine manager named English. Here we were joined by Lord &amp; Lady Northbourne, and another mining pundit named Anderson, a very intelligent fellow, with whom I had some interesting conversation. Also an aged fat man named Hodgson, the grandson of the parson who built the church.</p>
         <p>The service was attended by a congregation of which at least five sixths were women! It was too long – nearly two hours – by reason of inordinate hymn&#8211;singing. The people were very attentive to my sermon. We returned to Auckland immediately after the service. An open car will hardly serve my turn!</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The Masonic Lodge on Annfield Plain sends me a resolution asking me to use my "great influence" to secure the appointment</hi> of the Rev. F. Ferguson to the vacant benefice of Collierley!!</p>
