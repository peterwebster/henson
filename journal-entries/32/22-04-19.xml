         <p>There was an early departure of our guests save only Lucie SÃ¶derblom. The morning was spent in preparing for my own departure. After an early lunch I started in the car, accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; her maidens as far as West Auckland, where they started to walk home.</p>
         <p>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and I motored comfortably to York via Darlington and Northallerton. We went to the Railway Hotel, where rooms had been prepared for us, and afterwards essayed to see the Minster. Finding it closed, I went to the Dean<persName xml:id="4346"></persName>, who was at home. He most kindly lent me his own keys. With the assistance of the policeman on night duty, who turned on the electric light in the crypt, &amp; indicated the principal monuments, we inspected the great church. The brilliant sunshine showed the glories of the painted windows to perfection. William was, I think, really impressed, and appreciated the Dean's kindness. Afterwards, I had a considerable talk with the Dean about the proposed statement on doctrine. He seemed to think that something of the sort was desirable, and, though I suspect that he is far more technically orthodox that I would approve, he spoke with much genuine liberality of mind of the whole situation. I noticed with some concern that he has the gait and aspect of an infirm man, &amp; his wife's evident anxiety on his account tended to deepen the impression.</p>
