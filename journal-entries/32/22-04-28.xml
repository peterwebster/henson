         <p>I wrote to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> saying that M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Henson<persName xml:id="112"></persName> would be pleased for his sister to visit the Castle, and sending him two weeks wages. Then I did the correspondence with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>, &amp; wrote a letter to Lord Cave, sending him the scheme for the Cathedral, &amp; asking his advice as to procedure. After lunch I went to Durham by train, and presided at a meeting of the Religious Education Board. Knowlden brought forward a resolution in favour of making an effort to maintain the Church Schools. I poured a sufficiency of cold water on it to modify the resolution into a non&#8211;committal form. On my return I received the welcome tidings of poor old Maxwell's decease. He had long been imbecile: he was becoming violent: by dying he solves an embarrassing problem. The helplessness of the Bishop in face of a considerable scandal, for his utter incapacity to do his parochial work had lasted for years, created much prejudice against the Church.</p>
