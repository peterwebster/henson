         <p>Save for a shower at starting, the weather was fine. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> took the Lawrences &amp; Lucie to see the Roman Wall. Frank Berry went also as a companion for William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>. After lunch I walked &amp; talked in the Park with Ruth<persName xml:id="2161"></persName>. The party returned from the expedition to the Wall about 9 p.m., apparently well&#8211;contented. Ruth played in the State&#8211;room after dinner.
