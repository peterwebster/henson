         <p>I was lucky enough to get a sleeper at Darlington, &amp; thus travelled as comfortably as possible. I did not leave the train at King's Cross until 8 a.m. when I motored to Paddington, and caught the 8.45 a.m. to Oxford, where I arrived about 10.30 a.m. Frank turned up from Sutherland, Cholmondeley came, &amp; read the Psalm in chapel. Frank read the lesson. There was a fair congregation considering that the University has gone down. The service in S. Sepulchre's cemetery was very impressive, for the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang delightfully. I called on M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Dicey, and talked with her for a quarter of an hour. Lady Bryce was there, &amp; talked about her husband's<persName xml:id="389"></persName> death. I dined in college with Dibblee &amp; an American friend, whose conversation was most interesting.</p>
         <p>Holland, who is Dicey's contemporary, evidently felt his death acutely, and, perhaps, it added a touch of apprehensive sadness to Johnson's illness. I went to see him, &amp; found him established in bed in his study, frail and affectionate. His bird&#8211;sanctuary on the Cherwell has been handed over to Magdalen College, as it had been invaded by otters. I had no idea that these creatures attacked waterfowl. I supposed that they confined their attentions to fish, of which they are notable enemies.</p>
