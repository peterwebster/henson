         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8.15 a.m. All the Rural Deans &amp; the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="2785"></persName> communicated. After breakfast we had a conference on Evangelisation. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> introduced the subject, and it was discussed with animation. I took occasion to speak with decision about the Anglo&#8211;Catholic Mission. The clergy would only take part in it against my expressed wishes. Hudson Barker, the R.D. of South Shields, who had undertaken to preside at an Anglo&#8211;Catholic conference in his Rural Dean, inquired of me what he ought to do, &amp; I told him that he sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d </hi>withdraw his name. He said he would do this, &amp; I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> he will. After lunch the Rural Deans dispersed. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>, Knight, Gouldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>, and I left in the motor at 2 p.m. At Durham we dropped Gouldsmith. At Esh I dedicated the new organ, and preached a sermon. We motored to Durham &amp; had tea in the Club with J.G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>. Then Wilson, Knight, Clayton, &amp; I motored to Sunderland, dropping Knight at Houghton. I instituted Scott, the new Vicar, to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t </hi>Gabriel's, Sunderland, &amp; preached the sermon. There was a large congregation, and half a dozen Dissenting Ministers occupied a front pew. I was distinctly pleased with this service. Clayton, Wilson, &amp; I returned to Durham, where we dropped Wilson. We continued to Auckland, and reached the Castle about 10.30 p.m. It would not really be true to describe the life of an English Bishop as idle.</p>
