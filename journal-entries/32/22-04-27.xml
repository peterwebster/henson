         <p>I left Birchington after breakfast by a train which left at 9.12 a.m., and reached Victoria at 11.27 a.m. I went to King's Cross, and travelled to Bishop Auckland by the express which left at 1.20 p.m. and arrived shortly after 7 p.m. After dinner I went through the correspondence which had accumulated.</p>
