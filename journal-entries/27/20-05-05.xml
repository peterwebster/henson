            <p>I woke early, &amp; was compensated by the spectacle of a most glorious sunrise. An "awful rose of dawn" filled the eastern sky. Framed by the noble avenue, &amp; glowing through the bars of the fine iron gates which closed it, the rising Sun was a majestic sight, but it passed almost at once into a heavy bank of minatory clouds, &amp; left me with a noble memory &amp; grave fears.</p>
            <p>I started to read such books as were in my bag. I started on "Theophilus Anglicanus", once an accepted manual of Anglican teaching, &amp; soon had enough of that dreary &amp; precise dogmatism. Then I turned to "George Tyrrell's<persName xml:id="1084"></persName> Letters", which I found more to my taste.</p>
            <p>I left the house a few minutes before 10 a.m., &amp; motored by way of Shrewsbury, Westbury, Worthen, &amp; Marton to Middleton where I confirmed about 30 candidates, &amp; then dedicated war&#8211;memorials â€“ a Cross in the Churchyard, &amp; stained&#8211;glass windows to the memory of Edward Offley Wakeman. Sir Offley W.<persName xml:id="4695"></persName> &amp; other members of the family were in church. Then I motored back to Worthen &amp; lunched with Prebendary Alford. I confirmed about 50 candidates, &amp; then returned to Condover Hall, where I arrived at 6.10 p.m.</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold underline">The Archbishop's<persName xml:id="128"></persName> amendment that the newly&#8211;legalized marriages shall be celebrated at the registry offices was defeated by one vote. Rather to my surprise, &amp; wholly to my disgust, the 'Times' has a leader strongly hostile to his Grace's proposal. It speaks threateningly of Disestablishment as appreciably hastened by it</hi>, as if the unamended Bill did not actually necessitate that catastrophe.</p>
