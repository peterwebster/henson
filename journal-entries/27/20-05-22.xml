            <p>I worked at the Swedish Lectures, but to little purpose, being much interrupted. Holland<persName xml:id="5156"></persName>, the Vicar&#8211;designate of Weston, came to see me. After lunch I presided at a meeting of the Clergy Relief Society, which lasted for 1 1/2 hours, &amp; spoiled my intended walk with Lilley<persName xml:id="3618"></persName>. <hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Brillioth<persName xml:id="5198"></persName> arrived soon after 6 p.m. He is a tall, good&#8211;looking, young man, with well&#8211;marked eye&#8211;brows, a well&#8211;shaped nose &amp; chin, &amp; an intelligent head. He speaks English surprisingly well. He is engaged on a study of the Tractarian movement, &amp; is settled at Pusey house, where he is certainly not likely to underrate it!</hi></p>
