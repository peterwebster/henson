            <p>I worked on the Swedish Lectures, &amp; then had an interview with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Simey<persName xml:id="5196"></persName>, the Vicar&#8211;designate of Kinnersley: a young man (31) who is said to be a "Catholick". Then Rowlands<persName xml:id="4665"></persName>, the Vicar of Marden, came to supplicate a change of livings. He had shell&#8211;shock, &amp; pleads sleeplessness &amp; rheumatism. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> came from Bridstow, &amp; had some conversation about the Divorce Bill.<note xml:id="519" n="1"></note> He tells me that he highly disapproves of the "Times" leader on the subject, and that he has written to the Editor stating as much. Rushton<persName xml:id="4842"></persName> came to see me about the future of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Barnabas: &amp; then Wynne&#8211;Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName> came to clear off an accumulation of letters. He stayed to dinner. Beattie<persName xml:id="4506"></persName> also dined, &amp; afterwards went with me to the S. Nicholas schoolroom, where I presided over a small meeting of the C.E.M.S.<orgName xml:id="207"></orgName> which was addressed by Kemp<persName xml:id="4399"></persName>. Eckett<persName xml:id="4551"></persName> came in about 10 p.m. in a high state of excitement to "report progress" in the School business. The Governing Body meet tomorrow.</p>
