            <p><hi rend="bold underline">The post brings a copy of the "Christian World" containing the interview which I submitted to on Feb 19</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline">. It reads very crudely, and will do no good</hi>. I spent the morning on the Bradford sermon until lunch, when May, the Vicar came to see me. The poor man wants an increase of income, which is precisely what I have no means of giving him! Then I went to the Cathedral, &amp; heard and excellent discourse from Lilley<persName xml:id="3618"></persName> on the reunion negotiations between Bossuet<persName xml:id="5192"></persName> &amp; the Lutherans. Then I walked for an hour with Lilley: then I worked on the sermon &amp; wrote letters until dinner. Wynne Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName> finally declined the living of Weston under Penyard. The present incumbent proposes to resign on June 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>: unfortunately he will take a pension (probably &#x00A3;200), and the rates of charges on the benefice are said to amount to &#x00A3;170. The gross value of the living is said to be &#x00A3;685: the net income, so long as Craigie<persName xml:id="4949"></persName> survives, will not much exceed &#x00A3;300. The Rectory is a fair sized house, and there is a large garden. No man c<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be comfortable without private means.</p>
