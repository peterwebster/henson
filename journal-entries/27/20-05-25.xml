            <p>Still the bright warm weather. I worked at the lectures, and talked to my Swede, who lunched with Bannister<persName xml:id="3619"></persName> at Ledbury. He read through the part of my lectures which have been written. I gather that he desires me to say something in favour of Establishment, something which might be serviceable in Sweden where the question has still an importance of its own.
