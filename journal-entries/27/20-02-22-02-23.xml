            <p>A sharp frost, and a brilliant day. I received the Sacrament in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. Accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> James<persName xml:id="4292"></persName>. I motored to Pembridge, &amp; there instituted &amp; inducted the new incumbent, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Barber<persName xml:id="5151"></persName>. There was not a large congregation, but, perhaps, as large as one ought to expect. The rural labourers attend Evensong, if they attend any service at all. We all lunched with Sir Elliott<persName xml:id="4493"></persName> &amp; Lady Wood. A note from the Rural Dean was handed to me before the service reporting worse things from Monkland, &amp; suggesting that I should interview the parson on the way home. This I did – an unpleasant business. The cumulative effect of so many scandals of vice, indolence, &amp; incompetence in this district must be spiritually paralyzing – Leominster, Hatfield, Monkland, Stretford.</p>
            <p>I preached in S. Peter's Church at Evensong. There was, of course, a large congregation, mainly composed of young women most of whom appeared to be maid&#8211;servants and shop assistants. It had been arranged that the new organ should "show its paces" in a short rehearsal before the Benediction. But the instrument with a juster perception of what was fitting on the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Sunday in Lent than the Vicar, promptly "sprang a leak" (i.e. had a fused wire) &amp; refused to emit a sound. I was amused at the humiliation which this untoward incident evidently inflicted on the parson &amp; officials; but I could not resent very deeply an incident which relieved me from what at all times I mightily resent – an organ recital in the midst of Divine service.</p>

            <p>Dear M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Whitcombe<persName xml:id="5053"></persName>,</p>
            <p>I desire to repeat in writing the substance of what I said to you yesterday. The scandal of your ill behaviour in Monkland has reached a measure of gravity which I cannot possibly condone. You must either put an end to it by a prompt and thorough change of conduct, or you must make your count with the disciplinary action which it is my duty to take according to the law.</p>
            <p>That is the choice before you – reformation or prosecution. After a ministerial career of 45 years, it w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be lamentable indeed to "go out" and "go under" as a criminous clerk.</p>
            <p>I do entreat you to take the chance of recovery which I offer you. Look upon it, as indeed you should, as a Warning of God's Mercy, on which for you depends everything that a servant of Christ can value. <hi rend="underline">Nothing</hi> could give me deeper satisfaction than to hear that you had risen out of this terrible sin &amp; were addressing yourself to your duty in a temper of penitence &amp; resolution. There is so much good in your record that I shall cling to the hope that you will give me cause to trust you again as a loyal pastor of Christ's flock. Be sure that I shall pray for you.</p>
            <p>Believe me,</p>
            <p>Sincerely yrs.</p>
            <p>H. H. Hereford.</p>

            <p>I wrote to the Rural Dean, and to the Churchwarden, informing them that I had monitioned the Vicar of Monkland<persName xml:id="5053"></persName>. Also I wrote to the Chancellor with reference to the Hatfield case. Then I motored to Staunton&#8211;on&#8211;Wye, &amp; presided over the Trustees. We went through the Scheme, &amp; approved it. D<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Maples<persName xml:id="4993"></persName> came back with me in the car. He offered to serve on the Diocesan Finance Board. Then I wrote to Swinnerton Dyer<persName xml:id="5120"></persName>, and offered to spend Low Sunday in Diddlesbury.</p>
            <p>Too rashly I have pledged myself to go to Cardiff, and address a meeting in aid of the Lord Mayor's Appeal for the Starving Children of Central Europe. My information on the subject is limited to such accounts as I have read in the newspapers, and to Sir William Goode's<persName xml:id="5152"></persName> Report to the Foreign Secretary. The objections which may be fairly urged, and cannot easily be met, are mainly two: (1) What real use is private charity when so vast a calamity is concerned? (2) What guarantee is there that British charity will not take from the shoulders of the selfish minority the burden which assuredly ought to rest on them? Neither question is easy to answer. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowther<persName xml:id="1731"></persName> (on the authority of Sir Maurice de Bunsen<persName xml:id="5153"></persName>, as the affirmed) assured me with much confidence that there was food enough to prevent actual want, but that the selfish wealthy classes grabbed all for themselves, &amp; rejoiced to have all responsibility for the starving poor taken off them by the foolish magnanimity of their conquerors. But this I discount as one more illustration of the inhumaneness of the fashionable world!</p>

            <p>My dear Madam,</p>
            <p>I am obliged to you for your interesting letter. The "Catholick" type of Christianity has, no doubt, spread rapidly in the Established Church during the last half century, and does unquestionably appeal to certain temperaments very effectively. But the Church of England is, none the less, a Reformed Church, &amp; the Religion of its standards and formularies is that version of Christianity which grew from the Reformation. The Roman Catholick Church is the logical &amp; ultimate form of "Catholick" Christianity, &amp; I must needs think that the religious situation in this country would be both more wholesome &amp; more intelligible if those Anglicans who hold the "Catholick" version of Christianity would unite themselves with their true Mother, the Church of Rome. Their presence in the Church of England paralyzes the whole legal system, &amp; immerses them in a truly distressing casuistry. We are moving quickly towards disruption.</p>
            <p>Believe me,</p>
            <p>Yours v. faithfully</p>
            <p>H. H. Hereford.</p>
