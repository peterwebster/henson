            <p>A perfect spring day, bright sun and soft air. The country looked its very best when I motored to Ewyas Harold for the confirmation. The village is most picturesque, &amp; the church is not without good points, though vulgarized by execrable windows &amp; other introductions of purblind zeal. The new parson looks very fragile, and has a nerveless distracted manner. Pelly, from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Devereux, acted as my chaplain. I lunched with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Joseph Shaw<persName xml:id="5028"></persName> at Kentchurch. His house includes an old (probably 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century) tower traditionally connected with Owen Glendower. After lunch I motored to Peterchurch, &amp; confirmed 54 candidates, including 7 ex&#8211;service men. The church is one of the noblest Norman buildings in the diocese, and its splendid XIV<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century tower &amp; spire make an imposing figure in the landscape. Gray from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's carried the staff: Powell<persName xml:id="5143"></persName>, the Rural Dean, also attended. Holland<persName xml:id="5156"></persName>, the Vicar of Peterchurch, gave us tea in the house which serves as a vicarage. There was a very large &amp; attentive congregation. I was more than usually pleased with both these cofirmations. I got back to the Palace about 6.15 p.m.</p>
