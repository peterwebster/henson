            <p>I left the Palace at 9.30 a.m., and motored to Lucton where I confirmed 36 candidates, including one whom I confirmed in bed at home. The lad had attended all the classes, but had been smashed up in an accident last week. His name was Walter Stanley. I returned to the Palace, lunched, &amp;, accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and the Registrar<persName xml:id="4292"></persName>, motored to Leominster, where I instituted and inducted Gillenders<persName xml:id="5176"></persName>, the new Vicar. I took occasion to speak with some sternness about the state of the Church in Leominster. On my return about 6.30 p.m. I wrote to Rashdall<persName xml:id="117"></persName>, Fawkes<persName xml:id="1082"></persName>, &amp; Glazebrook<persName xml:id="4234"></persName>, telling them <hi rend="bold underline">that it is not my intention to answer the Bishop of Salisbury's<persName xml:id="178"></persName> very foolish letters to the Times of last Friday</hi>.</p>
