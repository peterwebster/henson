            <p>A perfect morning: the brilliant sun shining from a cloudless sky, &amp; all the world fresh in its colours, &amp; vocal with a multitude of rejoicing birds â€“ who would exchange this natural beauty for the chatter &amp; dust of the city?</p>
            <p>I went to the Cathedral at 8 a.m., &amp; celebrated the Holy Communion. My tall Swede communicated with the rest.</p>
            <p>I preached in the Cathedral at 11 a.m. to a considerable congregation and I attended Evensong. The singing was very excellent: and Lilley<persName xml:id="3618"></persName> preached a sermon, good in substance and expression, but not, I should judge, audible to the majority of the congregation. The Dean<persName xml:id="5128"></persName> came in to supper, and made himself agreeable. He expressed himself very liberally on the subject of marriage, and approved of Rashdall's<persName xml:id="117"></persName> Letter.</p>
