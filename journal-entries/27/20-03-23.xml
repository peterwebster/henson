            <p>I left Bradford at 9.18 a.m., and travelled by way of Sheffield, Birmingham, Droitwich, to Hereford, where I arrived at 6.3 p.m.; and was met by the car. Wynne&#8211;Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName> did the letters with me before dinner. Has the expenditure of these 4 days been justified? I am half&#8211;disposed to allow myself to think so. In the train <hi rend="bold underline">I read through the volume "The Skilled Labourer. 1760 â€“ 1832", a notable volume which deepens the sinister impression made by the authors' previous volumes</hi>. What an evil treasury of bitter memories &amp; too&#8211;well justified suspicions is in the minds of our common folk! That fact explains the Labour&#8211;troubles of the present, and paralyzes every effort at social reconciliation.</p>
            <p>A person, to whom I refused permission to officiate in the diocese, writes furiously to demand the reason. I reply that I will not grant him what he asks. Surely it would be impossible to accept the position that one must explain to every jack&#8211;ass why one desires to be free of him! Yet, placing one's self in his situation, would I "take it lying down", if I had been thus refused my request? For, he might fairly complain, 'your reasons, if unstated, may be misconceived, and a prejudice, perhaps of a very formidable character, may be raised against me by those who interpret them wrongly.' To which, I suppose, the answer must be that both the application and the refusal belong to the <hi rend="underline">arcana</hi>, and that, if they be made public, it can only be by himself.</p>

            <p>March 23<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> 1920</p>
            <p>My dear M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Muir<persName xml:id="4997"></persName></p>
            <p>You are good enough to ask permission to print the sermon which I preached in Eastbrook Hall<placeName xml:id="98"></placeName> at your Anniversary. I am very willing to grant your small request, and take leave in doing so to dedicate the sermon, in much affection and regard, to you and your people.</p>
            <p>The spectacle of your great Hall filled with men and women whose hearts were evidently aflame with good purpose and hope, gave me much joy and comfort. I pray that God's Blessing may be upon all the varied effort of your great Mission.</p>
            <p>Yours most sincerely</p>
            <p>H. H. Hereford</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">The principle at stake is the freedom of the Bishop to exercise his discretion without giving reasons. In the case of a clergyman seeking institution or licence, I apprehend, that he has something in the nature of a right, which the Bishop must respect, but there is nothing of the kind in the case of one who, for his own convenience, asks for permission to officiate. He may be a rogue seeking to rehabilitate his character for the purpose of fresh rogueries!</hi></p>
