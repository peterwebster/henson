         <p>I prepared notes for my speech in Glasgow, and then motored to Durham, &amp; took the train for Scotland. I was met at Glasgow by the son of mine host, and motored to his house, (Ravelston. 994 Great Western Road). The Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway is a handsome man ten years my junior. He accompanied me to the meeting of the Scottish Sabbath Schools Union in S. Andrew's Hall.</p>
         <p>There was a large assembly, and the Marquis of Aberdeen presided. A nervous gesticulating absurdity of a man, he moved my wonder as I reflected that he had been entrusted with the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland during a troubled period. I spoke for 20 minutes on "The Civic values of Sunday School" and was listened to with decorum, but without enthusiasm. Two secretaries followed, who roused the assembly to considerable fervour, but their voices were stronger than their arguments. We returned home as soon as the meeting was over. The Bishop and I sate on in his study until midnight, discussing the situation in the Church. He is evidently desirous of being as liberal as his position will permit: but probably that does not amount to much as the case of a bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church.</p>
