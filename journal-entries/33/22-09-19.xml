         <p>I worked at a sermon for S. Paul's, Darlington: but was interrupted by a wounded officer, who desired to get my help in getting married to an innocent divorcee. I decided to make some inquiries, and if they were satisfactorily answered, to marry the man myself. The refusal to make in this matter of marriage any distinction between innocence and guilt appears to me quite indefensible. But it may not be doubted that the divorce court is a sink of iniquity in which all moral distinctions are confused, &amp; one may take nothing at face value.</p>
         <p>Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> and I played bowls after lunch. Arthur<persName xml:id="3128"></persName> and Ellie<persName xml:id="3192"></persName> arrived for a short visit. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> &amp; Cosgrave came for a conference with Parry&#8211;Evans, who failed to appear! Then the two candidates for the Diaconate arrived. After dinner I examined one of them (Woods) in his Anglican divine. He had chosen Jeremy Laydon's Liberty of Prophesying, and seemed to have read it.</p>
         <p>The Trade Unions are reported to be starting an agitation against War with the Turks. They threaten a strike if any attempt is made to send guns or troops out of the country! It certainly will be a suggestive development of "Labour" politics if the Turks are re&#8211;established in Constantinople through the efforts of the Trade Unions. The soldiers almost universally, Conservatives generally are philo&#8211;Turkish, and curiously hostile to these woeful Greeks.</p>
