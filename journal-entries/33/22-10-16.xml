         <p>I am pledged to preach next Friday in the great Abbey Church of Selby. It is the anniversary of the Fire which broke out in 1906. The re&#8211;opening of the Nave took place in 1907, and that of the Choir in 1909. What shall I preach about? The church has rather an unusual dedication â€“ The B. V. M. and S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Germanus. Germanus was born about 378 and died 448. I might, perhaps, dwell on the value of great historic buildings as embodying national memories, and symbolizing eternal verities. They antedate all our sectarian conflicts, they claim us by a title which provokes no resentment. Hence they have a real value in mitigating differences &amp; unifying sentiment. Then there is the value they possess as sustaining a standard of aesthetic taste in the community.</p>

I gather that "Father" Frere is interesting himself closely in the continuation of the school for civil candidates. This hardly has a reassuring aspect for those who suspect that the Test School will be an instrument worked in the interest of "Anglo&#8211;Catholicism".</hi></p>
