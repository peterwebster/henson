         <p><hi rend="bold">Friday, April 30</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>Another wet cold day. I stayed indoors all the morning. Prof. Bacon &amp; his wife came to lunch. He has criticized adversely Harnack's theories as to S. Luke's authorship of the Acts. Welhansen sent him a friendly message thereupon.</p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">My 4</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline"> lecture</hi> was, perhaps, more closely followed than the proceeding lectures. The young men sent me a message that they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad to be able to ask questions. Bacon and Walker were warm in their approach.</p>
         <p>We had tea with a very pleasant lady of German extraction, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> White (n&#x00E9;e Schwab): and dined with Prof. &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Porter. She is a busy &amp; managing female: he a learned shy little man, reputed to know everything about apocalypses &amp;c. On our return home, we perforce betook ourselves to the dolorous task of packing. <hi rend="bold">[17]</hi> The post brought two small cheques viz. &#x00A3;4.4.0 from the 'National Review': &amp; &#x00A3;2.2.0 from the Christian World Pulpit. I sent both (=&#x00A3;6&#8211;6&#8211;60) to my bank in Oxford. Also I wrote to the Admiral.</p>
         <p>The papers report the Budget, an alarmingly Socialistic production.</p></body></text></TEI>
