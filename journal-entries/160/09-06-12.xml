         <p>The train was running through a pleasing but level country when I awoke about 4 a.m. Presently we struck the bank of the Yellowstone River, and never left it far distant until we reached <hi rend="bold underline">Livingstone</hi>. There were many signs that the settlers were entering into possession: the Government are carrying on considerable irrigation works in Montana, and, wherever the land is irrigated, it is found to be extremely fertile. The later stage of our journey was illustrated by a fine view of the Mountains, on which much snow yet lingered. <hi rend="bold underline">We arrived at Livingstone about 45 min: after time, and then took train for Gardiner (54 miles distant) which is the public entrance to the Yellowstone Park</hi>. The train ran along the bank of the Yellowstone River, which here had the furious aspect of a mountain stream in spate.</p>
         <p>At Gardiner we immediately got into the coach, and were driven for 5 miles through the Park to the Mammoth Spring Hotel, where we put up for the night. On our way we mostly accompanied the course of a rocky &amp; rushing river â€“ the Gardiner River: we saw some deer; and two large owls watched our approach to the Hotel with melancholy concern. We walked for an hour after dinner before going to bed.</p></body></text></TEI>
