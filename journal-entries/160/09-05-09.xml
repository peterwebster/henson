         <p>I preached three times (1) At Holy Trinity, Brooklyn (2) In the First Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn (3) in Grace Church at 8 p.m. There were large congregations on every occasion.</p>
         <p>The sermons were selected on a scheme of subjects. At Holy Trinity I preached on the essentials, "Authority in Religion"; to the Presbyterians I spoke of the ecclesiastical aspects of Religion; in Grace Church my theme was rather economic &amp; social, "The love of money". None of the sermons had any marked success; but all were decorously listened to. <hi rend="italic bold underline">It is evident to me that my formal style &amp; unimpassioned manner are not agreeable to the American mind. Their preachers are more eloquent and topical.</hi></p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Melish, the Rector of Holy Trinity, is an agreeable man, still young: very earnest &amp; liberal, a friend &amp; so far as that was possible a champion of Crapsey. He accompanied me to the Presbyterians. He brought into lunch the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, &amp; a lawyer named Shepherd. Both were very pleasant: their discussion of Rooseveldt was highly diverting.</p></body></text></TEI>
