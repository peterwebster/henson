         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Seattle</hi> â€“ A fine day, but with no clear views of the mountains. In the morning we went to the Exhibition, &amp; looked at the Californian exhibits, &amp; the Federal Gov<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi>'s display. The first is mainly a collection of fruits, woods and minerals: the last is partly historical, &amp; </p>
         <p>largely naval and military. </p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">It is not without significance that such obvious popularity should attach to displays of battleships and big guns in this country. Partly it is the colossal conceit of childhood, &amp; its lust of novelty which mark them Americans. Every petty scuffle in which a few Indians were despatched is magnified into a battle, &amp; recorded as an event of national importance. The "war" in the Philippines is spoken about with the solemnity with which a really great conflict might inspire a citizen: &amp; the harmless conquest of the Spanish fleet might be a modern edition of the Spanish Armada! All this is curiously absurd. But there are exceptions to this grotesque vanity. Major Benson spoke very frankly about the Spanish war: &amp; many times over in the Eastern States I was assured that educated Americans knew that the war was iniquitously forced on Spain by the American Government.</hi></p>

Here and there stood up the great stumps of trees cut down in the first cutting. Their size makes them particularly prominent.</p></body></text></TEI>
