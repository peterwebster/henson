         <p>A most glorious day. West Point looked ravishingly beautiful. We walked to the soldiers' monument – a column surmounted by Fame with her trumpet &amp; a wreath. This is, I believe the only monument to the regulars employed in the civil war. How small the standing army is maybe inferred from the fact that on this solitary memorial are inscribed the name of all the officers &amp; men who perished in that long struggle. Why does Fame have a trumpet &amp; a wreath? asked a little girl of an American officer: to which he replied, "Because, if you will but blow on the one long enough &amp; loud enough you will surely gain the other".</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Colonel had some further conversation on the Buffalo before saying goodbye</hi><hi rend="italic">. The fatal years were 1882 &amp; 1883. He had himself shot buffalo for the last time in 1884. The last recorded wild buffalo shot was in 1892.</hi></p>
         <p>Travers accompanied us to the station. We arrived in New York at 12.30 noon &amp; were met by <hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Gates</hi>, who at once carried us off to the Plaza Hotel where we lunched sumptuously. Then we visited the New York Zoo, and the National Art Gallery – a large &amp; varied collection. By this time we were fairly tired, &amp; glad enough to get home, dine, &amp; go to bed. The view from the house over the Hudson is superb.</p></body></text></TEI>
