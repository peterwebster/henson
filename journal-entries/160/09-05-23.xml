         <p>I prepared some notes for a short sermon to the cadets on a favourite text of mine, <hi rend="underline">"He endured as seeing Him who is invisible"</hi>. The cadets formed an attractive spectacle in their grey uniforms, whose numerous buttons made a crashing sound as they sate down. They did not sing the hymns, or make the responses as heartily as I sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> have expected but this may be caused by the strangeness of the Anglican service to lads mostly trained in non&#8211;episcopal churches. My sermon was listened to with much attention, &amp; I think appreciated. For myself it was a pleasant thing to speak naturally after the restraints of Mohonk. <hi rend="bold underline">We lunched with Travers, who afterwards shewed us the new chapel which is nobly planned &amp; nobly placed</hi>. Then came tea, and parade. This last pleased my greatly: the little ceremony of saluting the flag was quite touching. <hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Choate were among the spectators: I had a word with them</hi>. He is staying in the neighbourhood with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Osborn. After supper I talked to about 100 Y.M.C.A. cadets: &amp; shook hands with them afterwards. <hi rend="bold underline">Then I talked of Indians &amp; Buffalo with mine host until we went to bed</hi>.</p></body></text></TEI>
