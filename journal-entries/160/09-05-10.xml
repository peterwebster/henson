         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Dr Huntingdon</hi> shewed us over his fine group of buildings. We attended the morning service of the cr&#x00E8;che: where the children mostly Italians had a sweet aspect: we visited the choir&#8211;school (15 boarders) &amp; the lunch rooms for work girls. Then he motored us round New York shewing us with evident &amp; pardonable pride the cathedral now in building, &amp; the noble river&#8211;side with the 'Palisades' across the water. The millionaires' houses were more modest than I had expected. He accompanied me to the station &amp; so sent us on our way to Newhaven, where we lunched with the Stokes. <hi rend="bold underline">I delivered my final lecture</hi> to a full audience, &amp; bade a courteous farewell to the Professors. Stokes &amp; Williston Walker saw us off at the station.</p>
         <p>We dined on the train; on our arrival at Boston we were met by a member of the Episcopalian Club and driven first to <hi rend="bold underline">Bishop Lawrence's</hi>, house &amp; then to the meeting of the club. Here I made a speech which was very well received, &amp; then shook hands with a crowd of congress&#8211;folk and others.</p></body></text></TEI>
