         <p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, April 28</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>The fine weather still holds, but the wind is disconcertingly cold<hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I lunched with M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Newman Smyth. He has a fat wife &amp; three very plain daughters. He discoursed of the prospects of Reunion with much fervour: but he is too episcopalian for me!</hi></p>
         <p>Then I delivered the <hi rend="bold underline">3</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rd</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> lecture</hi> of my course: after which Prof. Bacon took us to the Country Club for tea: then mine host &amp; I dined 'in hall' with the students.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Greatly to my surprise I received 50 dollars as a fee for my hapless sermon on Sunday</hi>. Mine host took me to the Bank, where I cashed my two cheques â€“ 75 dollars.</p>
         <p>Finally we went to a reception at the house of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Holchkiss where we found assembled the fashion &amp; beauty of Newhaven. Indeed it was a well&#8211;dressed company, with a high average of good looks. <hi rend="bold underline">Miss Kitty Cheetham gave recitations (which were silly) and coon songs (which were profane)</hi> for the delectation of the guests. We returned home about midnight.</p></body></text></TEI>
