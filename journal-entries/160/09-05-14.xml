         <p>We attended the Congress both in the morning and in the evening. The 'Outlook for Visible Church Unity' was first discussed. An admirable paper was read by Bishop Doane: &amp; an equally admirable speech made by D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Huntingdon. A singularly narrow fanatic followed, whom I rent, perhaps too severely.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon the subject was 'The Office &amp; Work of the Holy Spirit'. I read a paper.</p>
         <p>We dined with the Suters at the Tuileries.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Clearly they are far more friendly to 'psycho&#8211;therapy' than most of us at home</hi>. I gathered, however, from the conversation that the medical faculty, after inclining to bless, now tends to curse the 'Immanuel movement'. D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Worcester, the head of this faith&#8211;healing system, is now himself incapacitated by illness: &amp; the crowd of cranks, mostly feminine, whom he has attracted, is hard to handle wisely. Meanwhile the sinister &amp; flourishing personality of Mary Baker Eddy fills the faith&#8211;healer's horizon.</p></body></text></TEI>
