         <p>Together with D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Grosvenor &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Zabriskie<persName xml:id="2365"></persName> we spent the morning in motoring to Lexington &amp; Concord to see the sites of the fighting. They are marked by monuments with very truculent inscriptions. We were delighted with the varied beauty of the landscape.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">We lunched with D</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> Edward E. Hale, who presented me with a copy of his book, "The man without a country"</hi><hi rend="italic">. He is a noble&#8211;looking old man, full of life &amp; humour. He has a pleasant library, with about 5000 books, &amp; an immense collection of pamphlets.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">I dined with the Cosmopolitan Club at Harvard. There were, it was alleged, 27 nationalities represented in the company. The Ambassadors of Germany &amp; Japan were present. I sate between President Elliot &amp; Colonel Higgenson. There were speeches. Mine was on "Patriotism &amp; Cosmopolitanism", &amp; was well&#8211;received</hi><hi rend="italic">. Bishop Lawrence joined us during the speech&#8211;making. As we motored homewards we stopped to look at a fire.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
