         <p>We had a somewhat hurried packing, the transfer men arrived while we were (inserted) yet playing round a half&#8211;filled trunk, which familiarity had rendered odious. However we succeeded in getting the stuff off, and ourselves too by the express which left Montreal at 1.30 p.m. and arrived in Quebec at 6.30 p.m. The dust thrown up by the train was abominable; &amp; it rendered still more trying the thunderous heat of the day.</p>

         <p>We were carried by the hotel omnibus to the Chateau Frontenac, a nobly&#8211;planned hotel set up on a fine situation overlooking the river &amp; the city. We dined comfortably, &amp; then walked on the promenade in front of the hotel. This is clearly a favourite resort of the citizens. A curious spectacle was presented by the countless myriads of moths flying round the globes of electric light, with which the promenade is illuminated.</p></body></text></TEI>
