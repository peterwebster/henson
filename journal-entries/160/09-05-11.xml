         <p>A telegram from Knox &amp; Fedarb<persName xml:id="156"></persName> dated yesterday reached us. It contained this lamentable message, 'Admiral died today'. Thus I lose a true friend &amp; a loyal colleague. Strangely, I felt when saying goodbye to him, that we should not meet again on earth.</p>
         <p>We attended the opening service of the Church Congress. I read the Gospel &amp; assisted in the administration.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon we were taken a long &amp; delightful drive in the automobile: <hi rend="italic bold underline">everywhere we observed the trees disfigured by a band of sacking tied round them about 4 or 5 feet from the ground as a means of arresting the ravages of an evil grub which has recently appeared in these parts</hi>.</p>
         <p>After dinner we attended the first meeting of the Church Congress: &amp; listened to a debate on "Socialism in relation to Christianity". A good anti&#8211;Socialist speech was made by M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> George Zabriskie<persName xml:id="2365"></persName> of New York: but most of the speaking was on the other side, with which the audience were clearly in sympathy.</p></body></text></TEI>
