         <p><hi rend="bold">Thursday, May 6</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>A brilliant day with high temperature. A thunderstorm in the afternoon, &amp; something like a heat wave. Thermometer said to be 84<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> in the shade.</p>
         <p>Mine host carried us off to his father's house, delightfully situated on the extreme end of a peninsula which juts out into the sound between Long Island &amp; the mainland. We went by train to Stamford, &amp; then were driven to his house. There we were hospitably received by his brother's wife, &amp; entertained at lunch.</p>
         <p>On returning to Newhaven we wrote letters: and attempted to settle arrangements.</p>
         <p>Prof. &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Williams came to dinner. He gave us an interesting account of the secret societies here. There are three of them, entrance into which is an object of social ambition among the students.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Gilbert<persName xml:id="1095"></persName> &amp; received a letter from Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName>.</p></body></text></TEI>
