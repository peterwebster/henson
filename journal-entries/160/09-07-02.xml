         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Vancouver:</hi> A brilliant morning. After breakfast we took the "Tally&#8211;Ho" coach, and saw Stanley Park. The trees are not on the "mammoth" scale, but they fairly merit the title "big trees" which is commonly given them. <hi rend="bold underline">Many of the biggest are dead at the top</hi>. Our enjoyment was much diminished by the presence on the coach of some clamourous American women, whose harsh, mirthless laughter and pert incessant chatter were a continuous desecration. I don't think they saw anything, for they were wholly given up to merely <hi rend="underline">personal</hi> word&#8211;play. "Having eyes they see not". We must in justice remember that of this "middle&#8211;west" type of American we have in the course of our tour seen but little. What a whole community of such people must be beggars imagination!</p>
         <p>After lunch we visited New Westminster. The tram car ran for an hour through partially cleared forest, in which homesteads were rising. The charred stumps of the big trees have a pathetic &amp; even bizarre aspect. I suppose they have been deliberately burned by the settlers. Some of these great monuments of vanished greatness have been put to base uses – <hi rend="bold underline">being plastered over with advertisements</hi>. New Westminster itself is a modest little town, with an air of quiet prosperity &amp; a Carnegie Library!</p>

         <p>The various Orientals are much in evidence here. Everywhere – indoors and out – </p>
         <p>as domestic servants and as labourers – are the Chinese, generally wearing their pig&#8211;tails </p>
         <p>bound neatly about their heads. The hotels are served by Japanese in the inferior grades. </p>
         <p>Hindoos, conspicuous by their diversely coloured turbans are employed as labourers. </p>
         <p>Besides the Orientals may be seen occasionally both Red Indians and negroes. The </p>
         <p>Europeans also are very mixed. Scandinavians &amp; Germans are numerous. What will be the</p>
         <p>final outcome of all this mixture of ethnical types!</p>
