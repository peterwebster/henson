         <p><hi rend="underline">Fargo</hi>. I wrote letters to Ramsay, Rutt, and Bob Bineham<persName xml:id="630"></persName>.</p>
         <p>The name, Fargo, is said to be that of a contractor who developed this country. This is rather disappointing in a land abounding with euphonius &amp; romantic Indian names.</p>
         <p>Young, the parson from Moorhead, lunched here. <hi rend="italic">He speaks much of his tolerant attitude towards the "saloons"; and his friendly relations with the saloon keepers. He says that on these accounts he is much censured by the non&#8211;episcopal folk. I could feel more confidence in him if he did not exhibit so boisterous &amp; aggressive denominational ardour. In the diocesan magazine I noticed that the total number of episcopalian (Anglican) communicants is said to be 2000. The population of the state being about 300000. It requires a very clear case to justify exclusive claims in these circumstances.</hi></p>
         <p>After dinner we motored round and about the town for more than two hours. There was a bright &amp; promising sunset.</p></body></text></TEI>
