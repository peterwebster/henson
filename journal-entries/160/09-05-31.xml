         <p>Raining but the air is heavy. We drove to the Senate House, &amp; expended an hour in listening to the debate on the Tariff. M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Elihu Root was on his legs when we arrived, &amp; speaking with</p>
         <p>much vehemence. The actual subject of debate was the proposed new duty on oranges &amp; lemons. This was vehemently supported by the Californian senators. The whole discussion threw a strong &amp; sinister light on protection. Nothing could be more nakedly selfish than the arguments advanced. The vote was in favour of a duty for which no possible case could be offered. Then we went to the National Museum, where is a considerable collection of Indian articles: &amp; the Smithsonian exhibition where is a fine show of stuffed birds etc.</p>
         <p>D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Cotton Smith, the Vicar of S. John's, lunched here. We had a brisk discussion of psychotherapy.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Bryce took me for a walk through the woods, in the course of which we feasted on wild&#8211;strawberries. At dinner George Adam Smith<persName xml:id="244"></persName> was present; &amp; we had much interesting conversation.</p></body></text></TEI>
