         <p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, May 29, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>We spent the morning in an expedition to Mount Vernon. The journey on the steam&#8211;boat down to Potomac was most enjoyable: the banks are thickly wooded to the water's edge. We noticed the sandy colour of the water. Arrived at Mount Vernon, we visited the tomb of Washington, &amp; then his house. It is all delightful. Great pains have been taken to preserve everything as it was in the time of his occupation. Many interesting mementoes have been accumulated. We returned by the trolly.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">After lunch we wrote letters. Then our hosts took us for a motor drive to see the country. The Ambassador &amp; I deserted the car, &amp; walked for some time in the woods which are beautiful. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">He says that he comes out thither to compose his speeches, being there immune from interruption since the Americans care not to walk so far.</hi></p>
         <p>Our dinner party was very interesting. The German ambassador, Count von Bernstorff, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dickinson, the Secretary of War &amp; his wife, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Norton, the under&#8211;secretary of the Treasury &amp; his wife, &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Bayard, the widow of the former Ambassador to Great Britain made up the party.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[48]</hi> [symbol]						</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dickinson explained to me that he was a Democrat &amp; a Southerner. We started on a discussion of the eternal Negro question. He said some interesting things. <hi rend="underline">Inter alia</hi>, that the blacks were extremely eager to get rid of their nationality. All sorts of quacks drove a thriving trade among them with nostrums for taking the 'kink' out of their hair!! The multitude of mulattoes were to be explained by the intercourse of the Federal soldiers with the negresses who flocked into the camps during the war, &amp; by the influx of dubious foreigners since the war.</p></body></text></TEI>
