         <p><hi rend="bold underline">In the train about 2 hours before reaching Sicamous:&#8211; </hi></p>
         <p>We rose at 6.30 a.m., packed, breakfasted, paid our reckoning, &amp; came away from</p>
         <p>Vancouver by the 9 a.m. eastward bound train. The first part of the journey was interesting </p>
         <p>for the line ran through bold &amp; varied scenery: but during most of the afternoon the </p>
         <p>outlook from the train windows was monotonous. The heat was great, &amp; induced a </p>
         <p>general abandonment of coats, waistcoats, &amp; collars. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> wrote a sheaf of letters: I read</p>
         <p> through a rather poor, cheap novel, &amp; then fell back on "The Oxford Book of English Verse".</p>
         <p>By a fortunate decision I brought with me the copy which the Admiral gave me when his</p>
         <p> wife died. Now it commemorates them both.</p>
         <p>I was interested in observing the rafts of lumber used in these parts. The construction is of</p>
         <p>the simplest. Five or six substantial poles chained together at the ends serve to create a</p>
         <p>sufficient enclosure of the floating logs.</p>
         <p>We reached Sicamous about 10 p.m. and went at once to our room.</p></body></text></TEI>
