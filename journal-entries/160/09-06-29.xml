         <p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, June 29</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>A dull morning. After breakfast I wrote to Raleigh<persName xml:id="14"></persName> &amp; Hine&#8211;Haycock<persName xml:id="122"></persName>: also I sent the form of agreement to M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Day of Yale University Press.</p>
         <p>Most part of a column of the "Victoria Daily Colonist" was filled with the report of an interview with me. M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Robertson &amp; a friend called &amp; arranged to drive with us in the afternoon. Then we strolled through the town until lunch&#8211;time.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Robertson drove us round the town. We left cards at the Government House, &amp; visited the Rose Show â€“ a sufficiently modest affair. </p>
         <p>After dinner I wrote to Beeching<persName xml:id="208"></persName> and Gilbert<persName xml:id="1095"></persName>. Also I sent cards to Leslie Hider<persName xml:id="1613"></persName> &amp; Ernest Bennett<persName xml:id="826"></persName>.</p>
         <p>The wild roses &amp; broom flowering profusely in the Park make a beautiful scene. There are no mammoth trees, but sufficient timber of many sorts. A small collection of birds &amp; beasts might, perhaps, be abolished with advantage, for the creatures are not well housed, &amp; have a dejected appearance. Nor are rabbits, jackdaws, guinea&#8211;pigs, &amp; cockatoos really worth exhibiting. The view from the flagstaff is splendid.</p></body></text></TEI>
