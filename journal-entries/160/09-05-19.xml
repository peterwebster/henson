         <p>We repeated the dolorous experience of packing: &amp; then hastened away (leaving a bag behind in our haste, which the excellent Kellner himself brought to the station), &amp; so travelled vi&#x00E2; Hartfort &amp; Poughkeepsie to Lloyd, where a trolly conveyed us to New Paltz. Here we were driven to <hi rend="bold underline">Lake Mohonk Mountain House</hi>. The road lay upwards through a very beautiful district, &amp; at end of the drive the lake &amp; the hotel burst on the view very surprisingly.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Our host, M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Smilie, received us with kindness. He is an old man, straight &amp; fresh&#8211;coloured as befits a Quaker, with a firm set of lips, &amp; the general aspect of an upright &amp; prosperous tradesman. He &amp; his deceased brother have established these hotels at vast cost, &amp; built up a flourishing business.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The discussion after supper was slow, &amp; we were sleepy. Rear&#8211;Admiral C. H. Stockton U.S.N. made an useful speech, but there was little beyond the usual windy platitudes in the rest.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
