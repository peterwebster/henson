         <p>A wet day. We hustled off in the rain forgetting the camera! Then we found our tickets out of order, &amp; had to get them exchanged. The delay cost us our train! However there was another in an hour's time.</p>
         <p>We reached Philadelphia at 1 p.m., &amp; immediately lunched at the Railway Restaurant. Then we chartered a hansom, &amp; were driven about the town. We visited the hall where American Independence was declared; gazed with suitable reverence at Liberty Bell, which is now cracked: visited Christ Church where the seat of the omnipresent Washington is suitably marked: &amp; paid our respects to the birth&#8211;place of "Old Glory". Then we came out to Wynnewood, &amp; were driven to <hi rend="underline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> Toland's house</hi> where we were to spend the night. </p>
         <p>This is a charming country house of the unusual and respectable antiquity of 200 years, surrounded by lawns &amp; large trees after the English fashion, &amp; comfortably appointed in all respects. Miss Rush, our hostess's sister, drove us for an hour. On the estate is W<hi rend="superscript underline">m</hi> Penn's house. The absence of singing birds in such a country seemed very surprising.</p>
         <p>Here, for the first time since our arrival in America, champagne was set on the table.</p></body></text></TEI>
