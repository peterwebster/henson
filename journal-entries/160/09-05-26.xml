         <p>I visited the dentist (D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Cotton) &amp; was 'finished up': for which I gave him 10 dollars. Then we went into the city: &amp;, after various wanderings through mistaken directions, reached the office of the Yale University Press, where I arranged to publish my 'Lyman Beecher Lectures'.</p>
         <p>Then we lunched at the General Seminary: &amp; after that function visited the <hi rend="underline">Natural History Museum</hi>. Here we were much interested, especially with the dinosaur &amp; other prehistoric monsters: &amp; with the specimens of the mammoth trees. One monstrous segment was dated from 550 A.D. to 1901. Then we visited the <hi rend="underline">Hispanic Museum</hi>, in which our host is more immediately connected. Here is a remarkable collection of Spanish literature &amp; art treasures. Two iron&#8211;framed chairs of the Spanish inquisitors gave a sinister suggestion. We dined in the Waldorf&#8211;Astoria Hotel, &amp; then went to 'the Man from Mexico' in the Garrick Theatre â€“ a sufficiently laughable comedy. We returned home about 11.30, pretty tired.</p>
