         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">Seattle</hi><hi rend="italic">:&#8211; We motored to the Exposition. Here an unexpected difficulty arose. Some members of the Exposition Committee, having seen in the local paper, an announcement that I was to preach in S. Mark's Church, objected on the ridiculous ground that my doing so would probably diminish the attendance at the lecture. This objection was proposed to me through the telephone, and supported by mine host. I replied that the point was novel, &amp; surprising: that I was accustomed to accept invitations to preach: that, therefore and in order to avoid local friction, I would cancel my preaching pledges. This seemed to be a course equally humiliating &amp; unavoidable.</hi></p>
