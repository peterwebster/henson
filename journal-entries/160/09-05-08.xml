         <p>We rose at 6 a.m.: completed our packing: breakfasted &amp; caught the 8 a.m. train to New York. We travelled in the car to Grace Church Rectory, 805 Broadway, where we were kindly welcomed by Dr. Huntingdon.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Fisher ("Justine") called to meet <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; show her some of the shops. Then we went to the C.P.R. office, &amp; got our tickets, &amp; ascended Singer's sky&#8211;scraper for the view.</p>
         <p>After lunch we went to Bronx Park &amp; visited the Zoological Gardens. They have ample space &amp; are able to set out their beasts very comfortably. The bears, buffaloes, &amp; deer were far superior to those in the Regent's park collection, but the latter is a larger collection, &amp; mostly better provided.</p>
         <p>At dinner the Bishop of New York (Greer) &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Grosvenor were present; I had much conversation with them about church affairs. Both are 'broad&#8211;guage' men. <hi rend="underline">I raised the subject of the Trinity Church Endowment, but this was clearly an unpleasing subject.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
