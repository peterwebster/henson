         <p><hi rend="underline">Fargo</hi>. The sunset was approved to be truly prophetic by a glorious day.</p>
         <p>I wrote letters to D<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Tait, Strong, &amp; Lady Frances Balfour. The morning was spent in packing, &amp; the afternoon brought urgency to the process, for we finally decided to go on to Bismark today. This we carried into effect, arriving there after 11 p.m., &amp; being put up for the night in the "Grand Pacific Hotel".</p>
