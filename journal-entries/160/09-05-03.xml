         <p><hi rend="bold">Monday, May 3</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1909.</hi></p>
         <p>A brilliant day. I attended the short service in Appleton Chapel. D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Gordon conducted it, there were about 100 students &amp; dons present. The President was there. Mine host tells me that his general practice is to attend the daily prayers. Certainly my mind inclines most to these entirely voluntary arrangements where religion, especially the religion of young men, is in question. We bade farewell to D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Moore &amp; came away by an express train to Newhaven <hi rend="underline">where we were met by M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> Stokes with whom we now took up our quarters</hi>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I delivered my 5</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> lecture</hi> to an attentive audience. If I may take seriously the language of the professors, these lectures have been appreciated so far: but I am ever sceptical of compliments.</p>
         <p>At dinner were two typical Americans from the west; but the conversation turned on the relations of England &amp; Germany.</p></body></text></TEI>
