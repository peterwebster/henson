         <p>A wet morning. <hi rend="bold underline">The post brought me 50 dollars for my fee as Preacher at Harvard.</hi></p>
         <p>The morning was spent in revising my lecture &amp; writing letters.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Lecture VI. was delivered</hi> to rather a smaller audience. I suspected that a base&#8211;ball match explained the fact of Sunday absentees. After the lecture the youth asked me questions for half an hour: &amp; then Prof Walker took me for a walk to the Base&#8211;ball field.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Bishop of New jersey came to dinner &amp; the Prof. of Political Economy. I tried to gather information with respect to the ecclesiastical situation. The Bishop said that the sacerdotalist faction, though well organised &amp; the cause of great annoyance, were not increasing in influence. The Americans are clearly much perplexed by our Establishment, which mostly they read through Nonconformist spectacles. The Prof of Pol. Econ. clearly supposed that there was an annual vote for the Church out of the taxes.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
