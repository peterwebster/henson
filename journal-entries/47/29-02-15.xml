         <p>I got up with the intention of motoring to York for the meeting of the Convocation, where I had undertaken to speak some words of welcome to the new Archbishop. But there was so much snow in the country, and the outlook was so unpromising that I despaired of arriving in time. Accordingly, I telegraphed my excuses, and remained in my room, where I succeeded in finishing that disgusting "Charge", which I sent off to Macmillan by the evening post.</p>
         <p>I finished reading "Montrose", and wrote to thank Buchan for giving it me. The book is learned, and fascinating.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Robin</hi> writes to report that a bittern has appeared at Wynyard:</p>
         <p>"It is quite tame and takes little notice when I am fishing for pike or shooting the ducks. If distracted, it merely flies to the opposite side.."</p>
         <p>This is interesting: and it is good to know that the Visitor will be protected. I wrote at once to thank Robin, and to confirm his good purpose.</p>
