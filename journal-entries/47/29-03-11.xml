         <p>A white frost introducing a warm day.</p>
         <p>I worked at a Presidential Address for the Diocesan Conference on Patronage. There came to lunch Canon Cosgrave, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dunn, the Inspector of schools, &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Popham, the diocesan Sunday Schools Director. Drury arrived afterwards, having been delayed by the collapse of his car. We discussed the question of the Church Schools in Darlington.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Felling where I instituted the new Vicar (Betts) to Christ Church. There was a good gathering of the local clergy, a very large congregation, and a service, hearty and reverent. I was both pleased and surprised, for under the last Vicar everything had fallen into a lamentable state. But during the long vacancy the services have been carried on by Philips, the Vicar of Christ Church, Gateshead, and the people have "pulled themselves together" rather surprisingly. The new Vicar is a young man with an attractive aspect, &amp; the reputation of being zealous &amp; hard&#8211;working. After the service we returned to Auckland.</p>
