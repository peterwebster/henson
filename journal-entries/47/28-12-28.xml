         <p>I completed and despatched a letter to Lord Davidson of Lambeth. Then I wrote sympathetically to old Chancellor P.V. Smith accepting his resignation of office. The papers announce the death "after an operation" of Archdeacon Money&#8211;Kyrle in Hereford. I wrote a letter of condolence to his widow. A box of peaches from South Africa "with best wishes for a happy X<hi rend="superscript underline">mas</hi>, William" arrived. That was kind of the boy.</p>
         <p>Our guests spent the day in visiting the Labour Exchanges, &amp; went away in the afternoon. I motored into Durham, &amp; procured presents for the Brydens, returning forthwith to the Castle.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Mordaunt Gore&#8211;Booth</hi> &amp; his son, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Paul</hi>, a big boy of 19, who has just finished his first term at Balliol, arrived on a visit. Also <hi rend="doubleunderline">Linetta</hi>. The presence of guests in the house is wonderfully disturbing. Even though I do nothing to "entertain" them, there is a restless atmosphere &amp; a general sense of flutterment, which make serious work all but impossible.</p>
