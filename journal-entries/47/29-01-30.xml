         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> reported that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gerald Marshall</hi><persName xml:id="18"></persName> died last Sunday after 3 days of illness at the age of 66. He was a very loyal comrade for 5 years at Barking, and I kept in touch with him ever since, though we rarely met. The number of my contemporaries grows quickly less.</p>
         <p>I went into Durham, &amp; instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dennett</hi> lately Master of the Choir School, to the Rectory of Shincliffe. He is an ardent Anglo–Catholick of the newest type, and his oleaginous and adulatory manner awakes apprehension in my mind. I suspect that his parochial motto will be <hi rend="underline">Excelsior</hi>!</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with Lionel and the dogs.</p>
         <p>At 6 p.m. I left the Castle, &amp; motored to <hi rend="underline">Wallsend</hi>, where, at 7.30 p.m., I addressed a meeting of about 300–400 people in the War Memorial Hall. The meeting had been arranged by the local branch of the <hi rend="underline">Diocesan Preventive &amp; Rescue Association</hi>, &amp; was presided over by the Mayor. I spoke for half an hour, &amp; returned to Auckland after the meeting, arriving about 10.20 p.m.</p>
