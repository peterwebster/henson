         <p>I worked on the Preface but not very usefully, until lunch time, when Surtees, the Rector of Brancepeth arrived bringing with him the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> E.F. Tallents, Vicar of Kimbolton, whom he had asked to accept the vicarage of Brandon, which has now been vacant for three months. </p>
         <p>Tallents is a heavy&#8211;looking man of fifty&#8211;six, with a slow, slightly pompous manner, &amp; a conventionally parsonic manner of speaking. He professes himself a moderate High Churchman, who abhors this latter&#8211;day Anglo&#8211;Catholicism. So far, so good, but will he get anybody to work with him on these lines?</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with the dogs, &amp; then had an interview with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Robinson, the very intelligent man who has charge of the Labour work of the Government in this district. Steel&#8211;Maitland recommended him to me in very emphatic terms.</p>
