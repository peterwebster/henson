         <p>I worked at the Article but without satisfaction. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Spencer Wade</hi> came to lunch, and afterwards walked round the Park with me. He seems to be making headway in Gateshead Fell, and arousing the jealousy of his less successful neighbours! I motored to Hedworth, and confirmed 53 persons, among whom was Rufus (<hi rend="doubleunderline">William Kay</hi>) my junior gardener. He has been bred a Wesleyan, &amp; was baptized in the Wesleyan chapel. I gave him a Revised Bible, &amp; wrote his name in it.</p>
         <p>The Rawlinsons spent the day in Durham, inspecting the house which they will occupy, &amp; making the acquaintance of their neighbours. They appeared to be pleased with what they saw.</p>
