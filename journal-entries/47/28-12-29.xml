         <p>A most beautiful day, but I was too dyspeptic &amp; demoralized to make use of it. Indeed, my condition weighed on me so far that I walked round to the doctor, &amp;, of course, found him out. However, he soon called, &amp; undertook with the facile omniscience of his profession to put me right. He said, in answer to a direct question from me, that, on the evidence of the bulletins he, as a doctor, did not anticipate that his Majesty would recover. It will be interesting to see how events will affect his prophecy.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Linetta</hi> and I walked around the Park together. We discussed the ecclesiastical situation with vehemence! She is far gone in the Erastian Latitudinarianism of Birmingham, adding to it her own distinctive element of embittered anti&#8211;Romanism. It is astonishing that the Church of Rome should provoke such fierce resentments in the minds of her deserters. That admirable man, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Abp D'Arcy</hi>, ceases to be a philosopher, &amp; remembers with difficulty that he is a Christian, when Rome is in question.</p>
