         <p>A hard frost and a bright sun, roads very slippery.</p>
         <p>I worked steadily at the Charge, and wrote a good deal, but not well. I am still uncertain in mind, and therefore confused in composition.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi> came to see me. He has just finished his examination in Durham, and is perilously confident about the result. He walked round the Park with me. I was interested to hear him say that the lads of his Club challenge him on the subject of the truth of the Bible, which, it appears, that the statements in the <hi rend="underline">Daily Mail</hi> or <hi rend="underline">Daily News</hi> is making by way of reviewing the Anglo&#8211;Catholick Commentary, have brought into doubt. He finds, as I can well believe, that it is no easy business to make the negations of modernism intelligible to ignorant Fundamentalists.</p>
