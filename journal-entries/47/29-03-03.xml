         <p>Bright frosty morning. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.; there were 7 communicants, including M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Elland. I wrote to William.</p>
         <p>A rapid thaw set in about 9 a.m., &amp; did much execution on the snow before nightfall.</p>
         <p>I motored to West Hartlepool, stopping at Wynyard on the way in order to see Robin who has been down with influenza. I found him in a remote corner of the great deserted house, fairly cheerful. <hi rend="bold underline">He says that a bittern has been captured at Aycliffe, &amp; surmises that it may be the same bird as he has seen at Wynyard</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I preached at Evensong in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aidan's with considerable discomfort because not only was I unable to raise the brass desk to the requisite height, but also my efforts to do so had the effect of extinguishing the electric light. After the service I went to the Vicarage, &amp; saw Knowlden, whom I found distinctly better, &amp; more cheerful about himself. When I had said prayers with him I returned to Auckland, where I arrived about 9 p.m.</p>
