         </p>
         <p>A mild day, and foggy at night fall.</p>
         <p>I worked at the charge, and then (after lunch) motored to Durham, where I presided over a meeting of the Lay Worker's Association Committee. Then I motored to Sunderland, &amp;, after having tea with the Rural Dean, instituted Woods to the Vicarage of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Hilda, vacated by Plummer's death. The fine church – it is the best in Sunderland, saving only S. Ignatius – was well filled. There was a good muster of the local clergy. I returned to Auckland Castle.</p>
         <p>The Prince of Wales paid a "surprise visit" to Auckland this morning, &amp; lunched with Colonel Headlam. I had received no intimation of his coming, and could not but assume that he had no wish to see me. Yet I could not but reflect on the sinister suggestiveness of the fact that the Heir Apparent should come to the very gates of the Bishop of Durham's Castle, and should ignore him altogether. Even in the sphere of benevolence the Church is now no longer desirable or desired. The wheel has gone full circle indeed.</p>
