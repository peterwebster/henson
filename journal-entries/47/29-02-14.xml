         <p>This extraordinarily cold weather continues. I spent the whole morning on the Charge, which now nauseates me!</p>
         <p>Unwin, the assistant curate of S. Gabriel's, Sunderland, came to lunch, &amp; walked with me in the Park. He meditates leaving the diocese, moved to his decision by want of money, &amp;, perhaps, a certain restlessness. I tried to persuade him to stay, but whether I succeeded is doubtful.</p>
         <p>The publishers send me <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Haldane</hi>'s <hi rend="underline">Autobiography</hi>, a stout volume of 355 pp. Apart from the interest of his life, and of the self&#8211;revelation of his character, I am curious to see how he frames his narrative, and the degree of candour which he allows himself in speaking of his friends. Of course, he was temperamentally cautious &amp; even lethargic: and there will have been a process of bowdlerizing in the matter of personal references, which will hide something even in his case.</p>
