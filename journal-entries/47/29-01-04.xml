         <p>I made a valourous effort to write the "Introduction" to the volume on the Four Major Prophets, which I too rashly promised some months ago. How easy it is to promise! How hard it is to accomplish <hi rend="underline">what</hi> one has promised!</p>
         <p>The Church Papers are not pleasant reading. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ralph Inge</hi> has attacked me again in a very indefensible way: and, of course, the mere suggestion of Disestablishment sends people crazy. I would not mind hostile comment, if only I could be assured that those who read it would also read what I have written, but, of course, I know that hardly one in a thousand who reads the one troubles to read the other.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi> came to see me. He says that a friend assures him that his name is included among those who have passed <hi rend="underline">Mods</hi>.  </p>

         <p>In a letter to the <hi rend="underline">Church Times</hi> (Jan<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1929) <hi rend="doubleunderline">J.E. Downing</hi>, writing from "Ecclesiastical Com<hi rend="superscript underline">ee</hi>, 1, Millbank, Westminster, says,</p>
         <p>"In my view, English Disestablishment is in fact a matter of Imperial and by no means merely local concern."</p>
         <p>What does he mean? In the same letter he differentiates between "the Irish &amp; Welsh Church Acts" and the Disestablishment of the Church of England, because the influence of the former was "local", but the latter "could not be similarly confined in its results to England." What are the extra&#8211;English results of Disestablishment? There is the statutory requirement that the King must be a member of the Church of England: but this surely has little real importance. Nor is there any reason why the King's Protestantism should not be secured by a short Act, if that were thought requisite. What imperial interest is bound up with the maintenance of the English Establishment? I know of none.</p>
