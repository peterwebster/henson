         <p>I motored into Durham, and confirmed 43 boys from the School, &amp; 3 choristers of the Cathedral. There was a considerable muster of relatives as usual. I enjoyed the service. <hi rend="i doubleunderline">Derek Elliot</hi><hi rend="italic"> saw me afterwards. He is growing, &amp;, Budworth tells me, is both well&#8211;behaved and intelligent.</hi>

         <p>I received, corrected, and returned to the Editor the proof of the Article entitled "<hi rend="underline">Disestablishment with Consent</hi>".</p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Jarrow, picking up Cecil Ferens on the way. There I instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Harry Dobson</hi> to the Rectory of Jarrow&#8211;grange. There was a large congregation including the Mayor who wore his chain of office. His Worship is a lay&#8211;reader, &amp; is connected with the Church. We returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
         <p>Dobson was ordained by me to the Diaconate in 1922, and to the Priesthood in 1923. He did well at the University, but is handicapped by a terrible pronunciation.</p>
