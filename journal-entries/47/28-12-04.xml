         <p>A marvellous sunrise, like the smile on the face of an evil woman Satanic &amp; seducing, and all the earth in white.</p>
         <p>I worked most of the day at the Harrogate Lecture, and finished by including some part of the little tract on Durham Castle which I wrote some months ago.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, Lionel &amp; I walked round the Park.</p>
         <p>I received from the publishers, a copy of "<hi rend="underline">The Book of Common Prayer with the Additions and Deviations proposed in 1928</hi>". Its publication evidently perturbs the perfervid Protestants greatly. They made themselves again ridiculous in the House of Commons last night by asking questions about it. <hi rend="bold underline">Today, Lang was enthroned with immense pomp in Canterbury Cathedral</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> The brief reports of his address give me the impression that he justified my expectations by avoiding any decided utterance, &amp; "talking large" about unity!</p>
