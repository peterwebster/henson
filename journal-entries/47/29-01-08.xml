         <p>Dibdin has a second article in the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>. I telegraphed, reply paid, to the Editor:&#8211;</p>
         <p>"I should like to answer Dibdin. Will you accept signed Article?</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Archbishop Lang</hi> wrote to ask whether I thought that any important interest would be damaged if the Bishops' Meeting were postponed, adding some account of his illness. I wrote at once to urge postponement, rejoicing secretly at the chance of escaping the fatigue and wasting of time involved in a visit to London.</p>
         <p>Walking in the Park, I found a school boy sketching (in this weather!). We walked round the Castle together, &amp; he promised to be confirmed. Before leaving he wrote his name, &amp; said that he was the only son of a widow who teaches in Stockton:&#8211; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Henry George Miller</hi> 
<hi rend="underline">30 Stanley St: Norton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees</hi>. He knew Fuller, the late Vicar.</p>
         <p>I received a reply to my telegram in these terms:</p>
         <p>"Gladly consider your suggested reply to Dibdin. Times."</p>
         <p>So I must again interrupt my Charge in order to write an article on "The Crisis"!</p>
