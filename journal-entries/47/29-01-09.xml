         <p>I spent the morning in writing the signed Article for the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>, &amp; sent it off before leaving the Castle with Ella in order to motor to York, for the Archbishop's Enthronement tomorrow. We stayed with General Sir Cameron &amp; Lady <hi rend="doubleunderline">Shute</hi> at Government House, &amp; were most pleasantly entertained. There was a delightful young aid&#8211;de&#8211;camp named Chayter, some connexion of the Durham family though himself born in New Zealand.</p>
         <p>There came to dinner &amp; stay, General Sir Percy &amp; Lady Hambro, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Fairfax, Lord &amp; Lady Hawks &amp; Colonel Buchanan. We had much interesting conversation. Mine Host cross&#8211;examined me on the Prayer Book Controversy, respecting which he was indeed woefully ignorant. Colonel Buchanan impressed me most favourably. He spoke in the highest terms of the Chaplains, whose work during the War had filled him with admiration. "No man ever deserved the V.C. more than <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mellish</hi>", he said. It was equally agreeable and surprising to hear such language from the lips of a distinguished soldier.</p>
