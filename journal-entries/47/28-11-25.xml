<hi rend="doubleunderline">Centenary Celebration at Seaham Harbour</hi>:</p>
         <p>A boisterous night preceded a boisterous day. This must be one of the stormiest Novembers on record. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered but 6 communicants, including Lionel and John. Lionel and I motored to Seaham Harbour, where I preached in the parish church at a special service, which was attended by the local civic authorities, including several Roman Catholicks. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Londonderry</hi> read the lessons. After the service we all lunched with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dillons</hi>. My sermon, on which I had bestowed more pains &amp; time than the occasion demanded, was listened to very closely, &amp; did, I imagine, make an impression. One of the churchwardens, some kind of mine&#8211;official, thanked me for my "<hi rend="underline">thoughtful</hi> sermon", an expression which is a welcome relief from "<hi rend="underline">eloquent</hi>" which is so familiar &amp; so unmeaning. After lunch we returned to Auckland.</p>
