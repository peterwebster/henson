         <p>A stormy night. There was something like a blizzard proceeding when day broke.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 8 communicants, including John and Rufus, who made his first Communion.</p>
         <p>I motored to Sunderland, and there dedicated the new oaken reredos in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Gabriel's, and preached. The congregation was largely composed of young people, mostly feminine. The vicar &amp; his two curates are all comparatively young. Youth draws to youth. We have too many sexagenarians in the clergy of this diocese!</p>
         <p>I wrote to Woods, the ass<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> curate of S. Westoe offering him S. Hilda's, Bishopwearmouth, which Plummer's death has vacated.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I went to S. Andrew's, Spennymoor. He read the service, &amp; I preached to a very meagre congregation. </p>
