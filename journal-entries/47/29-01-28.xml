         <p>There was a good deal of snow lying on the land, &amp; the most part of it was still in being at nightfall.</p>
         <p>I worked at this detestable Preface, which becomes more disgusting as I go on!!</p>
         <p>We all motored to Durham for the <hi rend="underline">Commemoration of Founders &amp; Benefactors in the Cathedral</hi>. After lunching with the Dean, we attended the service. The sermon (a good one &amp; well delivered) was preached by the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Southampton</hi>. Save for the unseemly circumstance that the congregation were sitting (&amp; so directed to do) during the reading of the Commemoration Formula from the Lectern (instead of the pulpit), the service was impressive &amp; well carried through. We had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; then returned to Auckland. The processional hymn, sung (not without difficulty) to the tune of "<hi rend="underline">For all thy Saints</hi>" was composed by the Dean. It was not poetry, but it seemed to <hi rend="underline">make sense</hi>!</p>
         <p>We dined early, as the Servants Party had been arranged for tonight.</p>
