         <p>A hard frost binds the world, &amp; strikes a chill into one's very bones.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered seven communicants.</p>
         <p>Ell and I motored to Darlington, where I preached in Holy Trinity, the 90<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> anniversary of the consecration of the Church by Bishop Maltby being observed. I was interested in the congregation, which was almost entirely composed of women and old men. Young men, &amp; men under fifty, were very few. There was, to be sure, a large choir of 12 men &amp; 22 boys. Now the Vicar, Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cosgrave</hi>, is a hard&#8211;working, able &amp; sincere "Anglo&#8211;Catholick", rather bigoted than extreme. There is something in the "make&#8211;up" of English people which makes them "jibe" at Anglo&#8211;Catholicism. We had lunch with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Forster</hi>. There came to lunch Major the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Hon. Thomas Chaloner</hi>, the heir of Lord Gisborugh, &amp; his wife. After lunch we motored to the Manor House, Eryholme, and had tea with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Guy and Lady Wrightson</hi>. Then we returned to Auckland.</p>
