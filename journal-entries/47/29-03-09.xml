         <p>["]Catholic intolerance is handed down from an age when unity subsisted, and when its preservation, being essential for that of society, became a necessity of State as well as a result of circumstances. Protestant intolerance, on the contrary, was the peculiar fruit of a dogmatic system, in contradiction with the facts &amp; principles on which the intolerance   actually existing among Catholics was founded. â€¦. The only instance in which the Protestant theory has been adopted by Catholics is the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.["]</p>

         <p>Ella, Lionel and I motored to Sunderland, and, after picking up Wynne&#8211;Willson on the way, went to S. Andrew's, Roker, where I formally opened, and dedicated the fine Parish Hall and buildings connected therewith. The donor, Sir John Priestman, has expended &#x00A3;7,500 on the fabrick. There was a numerous company which filled the Hall for the opening service. I delivered an address, and afterwards was shown over the building. Then we all had tea with Sir John, and Lady Priestman, after which we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>There I found another batch of proofs from Macmillan.</p>
         <p>Spedding came, and resumed his difficult and comfortless efforts to adapt what he calls "dentures" to my preposterous jaws! In view of a cross&#8211;channel passage, the stability of one's teeth is a matter of equal uncertainty &amp; importance! The Channel&#8211;Tunnel will come too late for my use.</p>
