         <p>A beautiful and spring&#8211;like day: but I must have contracted a slight chill yesterday, for after a disturbed night I spent a comfortless day. It seemed to me prudent to telegraph to the Barnard Castle School, crying off my attendance at the Governors' Meeting. I worked at the Presidential Address for the Sunday School H Council in April.</p>
         <p>Two more seats have been lost by the Government. â€“ <hi rend="underline">North Lanark</hi> where a Conservative majority of 2,028 has been changed to a Labour majority of 6,578: and <hi rend="underline">Holland&#8211;with&#8211;Boston</hi>, where, in a Quadrangular contest, the Liberal candidate has a majority of 3,706. The last is very significant, &amp; may show the effect of Lloyd&#8211;George's agricultural programme on the rural voters. The prophets, who were very confident that Baldwin would return with a small majority, are now changing their tune. They speak of "Labour" being the largest single party, and some kind of a coalition Government being formed: or Macdonald being made Prime Minister by the grace of Lloyd George. The outlook is not a pleasant one for those who, like the Bishop of Durham, have fixed incomes, &amp; "live up" to them. "Wait &amp; See" is the only attitude for such times.</p>
