         <p>My article appears in the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> under the heading "<hi rend="underline">The Bishops and the State. Sir L. Dibdin's Argument. Reply by D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> Henson</hi>." It coheres, &amp; reads easily, but if I had not written it so hastily, I could have made it much better.</p>
         <p>I paid &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">500</hi> on account of Income Tax: and &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">78:17:7</hi> on account of the Visitation. During the afternoon, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Tony Chute</hi> and I walked in the Park for nearly two hours. The melting snow made walking rather toilsome.</p>
         <p>I wrote to the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev. F.A. Rainbow</hi>, offering to nominate him to Consett, &amp; coupling with it the Rural Deanery of Lanchester. The Russian Prince came to dinner, &amp; then went with Ella and Fearne to a dance in Durham. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Tony</hi> came to my room, &amp; we gossiped together until prayer&#8211;time. I gave him a copy of "<hi rend="underline">Cross&#8211;Bench Views of Current Church Questions</hi>" â€“ a volume which has a certain melancholy interest as a record of my opinions when I first went to Westminster. <hi rend="bold underline">It is astonishing how little I have changed</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>
