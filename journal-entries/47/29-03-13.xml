         <p>The weather continues to be warm.</p>
         <p>Ella, Lionel, and I motored to Newcastle where I arranged with Cook's Agency about the tour abroad, had my spectacles mended, and had my hair cut. After depositing Ella at the Gateshead rectory, Lionel and I returned to Auckland for lunch. Then I walked in the Park, and, on my return, finished the Presidential Address.</p>
         <p>The local tailor (who told me that he regularly made my predecessor's clothes) came &amp; measured me for a suit which would serve me abroad. – a little round dapper man who might have illustrated tailor&#8211;dom in any age. </p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Durham, where I confirmed 130 persons in S. Margaret's Church. There was much coughing, the audible evidence of the influenza epidemic which has been ravaging Durham.</p>
