<hi rend="doubleunderline">Diocesan (Business) Conference</hi>:&#8211;</p>
         <p>I motored into Durham, and presided over the meeting of the Diocesan Conference. There was but a moderate attendance: no doubt the prevailing epidemic of influenza has multiplied funerals, to conduct which many incumbents had to remain in their parishes. My Presidential Address took about 40 minutes in delivery. It was listened to with attention, but not received with any marked approval. However the clergy &amp; laity applauded decently at the end. I doubt whether they feel any great interest in the Patronage question, which I discussed: &amp; I suspect that they dislike the present bishop's method of administering his patronage. The business was gone through with almost embarrassing ease, and everything was finished before 3 p.m. I gave lunch in the Castle to six incumbents, &amp; afterwards had a walk in the Banks with the Bishop of Jarrow, with whom I discussed some diocesan business.</p>
