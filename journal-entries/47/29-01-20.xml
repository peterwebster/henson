         <p>A thick pall of fog lay on the land when day broke, &amp; though it was not cold, it was certainly "raw" â€“ an ill&#8211;looking world indeed. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 12 communicants including the four Brydens &amp; Rufus.</p>
         <p>I worked at the Preface most of the morning: &amp; walked round the Park in the afternoon. Canon Hicks was brought to tea by M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Parry&#8211;Evans. When they had gone, I wrote to William, and to that indefatigable antiquarian Miss Scott Thomson, who had sent me some extracts referring to Auckland Castle.</p>
         <p>Also, I wrote an answer to some foolish parson who had written to me about Disestablish<hi rend="superscript underline">mt</hi>, and enclosed a stamped envelope for a reply! He wanted to know <hi rend="underline">why</hi> we must assume that Disestablishment must be accompanied by Disendowment. It is rather like asking why must we assume that a man has no more than two eyes. I could but say that the association of the two had hitherto been invariable.</p>
