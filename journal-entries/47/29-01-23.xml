         <p>The weather has become suddenly mild. My morning's work was confused by the preparation of notes for a speech &amp; a sermon to be delivered later in the day, but I succeeded in doing something on the Preface. At 3 p.m. the King's Hall was crowded with unemployed miners. I spoke for about 10 minutes in advocacy of emigration for the younger men, &amp; then introduced the lecturer, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Plant, who did not seem to me very happy. Jimmie Dobbie arrived about 4 p.m., &amp; accompanied me to Annfield Plain, where I consecrated the new church. He acted as my staff–bearer. He and Gerald Linnell<persName xml:id="5468"></persName> returned with me to the Castle, &amp; stayed the night. I was surprised agreeably by the comparative dignity of the new church, which has only cost £<hi rend="doubleunderline">4000</hi>. There was a considerable muster of the clergy from the Rural Deanery, and a very large congregation. Dick was in the seventh heaven. He has had much to daunt &amp; discourage him, so that the achievement of the Consecration was really very gratifying. </p>
