         <p>A fine day, and mild. Jimmie Dobbie read the prayers in chapel, and Gerald Linnell the lesson, and both did well. Ella and I motored into Durham, &amp; attended the meeting of the Preventive &amp; Rescue Association. The atmosphere was electric, and only my presence in the chair prevented an unseemly conflict between Medusa &amp; my little Suffragan. It was apparent, however, that the general sentiment of the meeting inclined to Medusa, and we postponed the proposed re&#8211;construction of the Preventive &amp; Rescue Work (subtly designed to secure the retirement of Medusa) until a special meeting. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Medusa</hi> happily announced her resignation.</p>
         <p>We returned to Auckland after the meeting, &amp;, after lunch, I walked round the Park. On my return I did some work on the Preface, &amp; then the doctor arrived, &amp; completed his inoculation of me against influenza. The local papers report at some length my observations at the Meeting yesterday. It would be interesting to hear the comments of the unemployed youths. They are, I think, beginning to absorb the idea of emigration as something possible for themselves.</p>
