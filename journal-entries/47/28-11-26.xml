         <p>A bright day, and colder. I made a start on the article for the "<hi rend="underline">Nineteenth Century &amp; After</hi>" on "<hi rend="underline">Disestablishment by agreement</hi>". I wrote about one third of the necessary amount: and what I wrote was very unsatisfactory. In the afternoon, Lionel and I walked round the Park. Ella and Fearne spent the day in attending the Prize Distribution at Barnard Castle School, &amp; paying calls. Lilley sent me a book which he has written on "<hi rend="underline">Sacraments: a study of some moments in the attempt to define their meaning for Christian Worship</hi>." It is published by the Student Christian Movement.</p>
         <p>I decided to offer Heworth to Ridley Barker, the Vicar of Crook. He has been in his present position for no less than 15 years, &amp; may be glad of a change. But he will hardly gain in income.</p>
