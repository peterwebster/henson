         <p>Rawlinson and his wife left after breakfast. I continued work on the Article, which grows more offensive to me daily!</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Langton Heaver</hi>,<persName xml:id="5584"></persName> the assistant curate of Crook, came to see me. After lunch we walked in the Park, &amp;, falling in with old D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Cullagh, took him with us. The day was calm &amp; bright, &amp; there was a wonderful sweetness in the air, which made walking most enjoyable. After tea, Heaver went off. He is an excellent young fellow. Sir Francis &amp; Lady Greenwell came to tea.</p>

The difficulty is that there are several mission churches, &amp; small prospect of finding the indispensable curates. <hi rend="bold underline">All the larger parishes are now worth Â£400 per ann: so that there is rarely any financial gain in accepting "preferment"!</hi>
