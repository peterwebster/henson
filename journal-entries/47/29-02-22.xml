	           The thaw proceeds rapidly: most of the snow has already disappeared.</p>
	          <p>I took Peers to see Staindrop Church. We called at the Vicarage, &amp; got hold of Spurrier, who acted as guide.</p>
	          <p>We both attended the meeting of the Durham Castle Preservation Fund in the afternoon: when it was agreed to proceed at once with a part of the work which will cost &#x00A3;30,000. It was reported that we have so far received &#x00A3;36,000.</p>
	          <p>Then I went to Evenwood, and instituted the Rev<hi rend="superscript underlinenderline">d</hi>  Albert Simpson to the Vicarage. It was an impressive, and, I trust, edifying service.</p>
	          <p>D<hi rend="superscript underlinenderline">r</hi>  &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underlinenderline">rs</hi>  Jackson from Chester-le-Street dined here.</p>
         <p>Before going to bed I had much talk with Peers. He is an intelligent and amiable man, evidently master of his subject, that is, medieval architecture. He told me that at Rievaulx Abbey, they had found the relics in the altars, &amp; had interred them in Rievaulx Parish church. But this was a secret.</p>
