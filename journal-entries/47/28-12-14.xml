         <p>I spent the morning revising the charge, &amp; making a précis for the newspapers. In the afternoon I walked in the Park with the Doctor. After an early dinner – Ella, Fearne, &amp; Lionel having gone to Durham for some kind of foolish entertainment – I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Marshall Lang</hi>, the Minister of Whittingham, who had made inquiry about the Head of S. Oswald. I could not but refer him to the Victoria History of Durham, where all the relevant information is collected. He reminded me that he was the "humble Presbyterian brother" of "<hi rend="doubleunderline">Cosmo Cantuar</hi>:"! How diverse are the fortunes of men! There can be no doubt that the English Establishment opens a larger sphere for ambition than the Scottish. Yet it <hi rend="doubleunderline">is</hi> very difficult to understand <hi rend="italic">why these Scots should march to the front with such ease. They are pliant &amp; plausible: they hang on to the "great men": and they have the national "genius of success".</hi>
