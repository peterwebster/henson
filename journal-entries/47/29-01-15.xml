         <p>[']The Church of England may be tolerant, but <hi rend="bold underline">it must be something</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> I think that the present crisis is more serious than previous ones because it raises that point. The cry, "Why should not congregations do as they like?" really resolves the Church into a loose covering of the religious consciousness, not of the nation, but of small bodies of Christian people, held together by no principle of cohesion but convenience. The tolerance which the extreme people ask for is the right to do whatever they like, irrespective of the organisation to which they belong.<hi rend="doubleunderline">[']</hi>

         <p>I worked on the Apologetic Preface, but with little success. In the afternoon I walked in the Park. The gardeners with Bryden were engaged on cutting up the big beech tree which was blown down two years ago, &amp; has not hitherto been removed because of the inconvenient situation in which it lies. Ella &amp; Fearne went to Sunderland to attend Stephenson's party.</p>
