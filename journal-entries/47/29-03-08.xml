         <p>Philip went off after breakfast, and I set myself to writing letters. Among these was one to Arthur Rawle, thanking him for "<hi rend="doubleunderline">Today and tomorrow</hi>", and indicating some criticisms on its general position. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Holme</hi>, the Rector of Penshaw, came to lunch. He wished to invoke my aid in his application for the Crown living of Waltham, near Grimsby. This I could not properly refuse, and I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Geoffrey Fry</hi> in his behalf.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cullagh</hi> and I walked round the Park. The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> A.M. Stephens</hi> came to see me about his employment in this diocese during his residence in Durham in pursuit of a degree â€“ a soft youth enough, but said to be trustworthy.</p>
         <p>The first proofs of "<hi rend="underline">Disestablishment</hi>" arrived. Lionel and I motored to Sacriston, where I confirmed 44 persons from the 3 parishes of Sacriston, Witton Gilbert, and Kimblesworth. The combined populations of these parishes exceeds 13,000. Nothing could be feebler or more ineffective than two of these incumbents, &amp; the third is not remarkable!</p>
