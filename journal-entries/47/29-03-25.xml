         </p>
         <p>I received a long letter from the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> C.H. Robinson, the Minister of Melbourne Baptist Church, Derby, who had been moved to write to me by some report of my Address on Patronage, which he had read in "The Times". He expresses himself with some vigour against the election of ministers by the congregation, which is the system of appointment which obtains in the Baptist sect.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I walked round the Park. The fineness of the day made everything delightful, but my heavy cold so weighs on me, that I can enjoy nothing.</p>
         <p>Lionel motored me to Hartlepool, where I confirmed 123 persons in S. Oswald's Church. It was a disappointing service. Why will these Anglo&#8211;Catholics go out of their way to belittle every religious function, save only the Mass. I observe particularly their studied contempt for Confirmation. Tonight, no choirmen were present: there was no hymn before the service, &amp; Lilburn, the Vicar, seemed rather ostentatiously unconcerned. This may be theoretically right enough: but practically it is a grave mistake.</p>
