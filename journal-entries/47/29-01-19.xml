         <p>A rapid thaw in the night continued through the day, &amp; cleared away the snow so effectively that, when I walked round the Park in the afternoon, there were few traces of it left. I worked at the Preface which does not gain coherence as it becomes longer.</p>
         <p>What strikes me about Creighton's type of Anglicanism is its megalomanical self&#8211;sufficiency e.g. "The Church of England has before it the conquest of the world." Only on a complete identification of the Church of England with the English&#8211;speaking peoples could the statement be even plausible: and such an identification ought surely to be impossible for an educated man.</p>
         <p>"The Church of Rome is the Church of decadent peoples: it lives only on its past, &amp; has no future." Yet the Church of Rome is the only section of the Christian family has emerged from the Great War with enhanced prestige. Revolution in Russia has almost destroyed her most considerable rival: and as to the Protestant Churches they are evidently in the way to dissolve.</p>
