         <p>A thaw set in, &amp; quickly changed the snow into slush â€“ welcome but repulsive. I went on with the Preface all the morning: in the afternoon I motored to Durham, &amp; presided over a meeting of the Board of Religious Education. Then I had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow, and discussed diocesan business.</p>
         <p> I wrote to Thompson, Vicar of S. John's, Darlington, offering him Consett, which Rainbow had declined.</p>

"I have one little fault to find, &amp; that is that your style is too faultlessly clear! The thought finds such perfect intellectual expression that one would welcome a little shade amid so great a shining of the light." He adds a request that I would preach in S.
