         <p>Ella and I travelled to London by the early train, which arrived in King's Cross punctually, so that we had ample time to get to the Church, (Holy Trinity, Sloane Street) for the wedding of Kathleen Parker&#8211;Smith at 2.30 p.m. Canon Gordon, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Walter Smith, &amp; a curate assisted me in the service. <hi rend="underline">I did the marrying, and gave the address</hi>. The reception was held at 45, Cadogan Place, lent by M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Percy Low. <hi rend="underline">I slipped away to call </hi><hi rend="italic underline">on Gore at 27 Eaton Terrace</hi><hi rend="italic">. He was in ill case with a sharp attack of lumbago. He gave me his little book, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Jesus of Nazareth</hi><hi rend="italic">", which he has written for the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Home University Library</hi><hi rend="italic">", and which was very favourably reviewed in the</hi> 
<hi rend="underline">Times</hi> this morning. We returned to the North by the 5.30 p.m. express, dining on the train at the same table with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Robin</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Stopford. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ford, the wife of the Dean of York, was also in the train. She came into our carriage, &amp; gave no satisfactory account of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cosmo Cantuar</hi>: whom she had seen. At Darlington the car met us, &amp; so we came to the Castle about 10.45 p.m.</p>
