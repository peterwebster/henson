         <p>Lionel and I motored into Durham, where I visited the book&#8211;shop, and bought Christmas presents. Then I went to the Castle, &amp; instituted the new Vicar (Betts) of Collierley. Also, I licensed Llewelyn to New Shildon, &amp; took him back to lunch at the Castle. Then Lionel &amp; I walked in the Park for more than an hour: after which I fell to preparing my Charge for the Ordination Candidates.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The newspapers print most of the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">précis</hi><hi rend="italic"> of my Charge yesterday. The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Manchester Guardian</hi><hi rend="italic"> gives most. The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic"> heads its report, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Lawless Clergy – Bishop of Durham on Discipline</hi><hi rend="italic">". I suspect that most of the "Anglo&#8211;Catholicks", who were not displeased with the first part of the Charge, will be alienated by the second. It is one thing to assert the "inherent authority" of the Church against the House of Commons: and quite another thing to assert it against lawless clergymen. Yet the two are essentially connected, and cannot reasonably be severed.</hi>
