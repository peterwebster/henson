<hi rend="bold">Monday, December 10</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A very cold day. The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> reports 21 degrees of frost in the South of England.</p>
         <p>I worked at the Charge, but what I want to say on the subject of discipline would far exceed my limits.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Lionel and I motored to Middlesborough, and dined with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Sykes</hi><hi rend="italic">, the fat Vicar of S</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi> 
<hi rend="italic">John's, before going to the Town Hall, where I was to take the chair at a lecture by Professor </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Hamilton Thompson</hi><hi rend="italic"> on "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">The historical position of the Church of England</hi>". <hi rend="italic">I made a short speech at the beginning, &amp; summed up briefly at the end. The lecture was good, but the coldness of the Hall struck a chill into the audience. There were about 450 people, mostly old men, women, &amp; the local clergy. The young men are only conspicuous by their absence. Perhaps something must be allowed for the effect of the war in destroying the younger men. After the meeting had ended, we returned to Auckland Castle, arriving shortly after 10 p.m.</hi>
