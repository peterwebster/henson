         <p>I finished the Cathedral Sermon, and wrote a number of letters. After lunch, Ella, Fearne &amp; I motored to Raby, where we lunched with the Barnards, and then went to Staindrop. Lord Barnard presided over a crowded meeting in the new Church Schools, which Lord Londonderry declared "open", and I dedicated with prayers. Then we returned to Auckland, and, after taking a short "constitutional" in the garden, I settled into my study.</p>
         <p>"<hi rend="underline">The Charles James Fox Association</hi>", a society of Oxford Undergraduates, writes to ask me to dine at "The Randolph", and discourse to them on "<hi rend="underline">Disestablishment</hi>". A few days ago the Editor of the <hi rend="underline">Cambridge Review</hi> asked me to write an Article on that subject, in which he said the undergraduates were keenly interested. This is, perhaps, a "sign of the Times".</p>
         <p>I promised the Bishop of Edinburgh that I would preach in his Cathedral on October 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> when it celebrates its "Jubilee".</p>
