         <p>Morning mist, and somewhat colder.</p>
         <p>I revised carefully the Presidential Address, and inserted a "purple patch" about parsons' wives. The poor ladies have few champions now, and yet, if patient unselfish service, unheeded &amp; unrewarded, were the basis of consideration in society, I verily think that these unattractive &amp; unpopular persons would stand well forward. I am quite sure that mission=preachers &amp; fashionable divines of every kind would be at the bottom, a grade above the criminal classes!</p>
         <p>Richardson, an Ordination candidate, lunched here: and, after his departure, Lionel &amp; I walked round the Park.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to West Hartlepool, where I confirmed 79 persons in S. James's Church. Before the service I was taken by the Vicar (Coates) to two houses; in the one, I confirmed a sick woman, in the other, I confirmed a sick boy. There has been, and is still, an epidemic of influenza in the parish. This circumstance may explain the tempest of coughing, through which, with difficulty, I conducted the service.</p>
