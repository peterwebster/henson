         <p>This day was completely wasted. I went through my Journal in 1919 and 1920 in order to recall my attitude towards the Enabling Act, which I joined Bishop Knox in opposing. Its inconsistency with the Establishment was my constant theme. But I cannot make up my mind as to the form of the personal Apologia which I meditate. To quote my <hi rend="underline">Journal</hi> at length would be most convincing, but also less interesting. Probably it would be best to aim at a literary effect, and reserve extracts from the <hi rend="underline">Journal</hi> for an Appendix.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Philip Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</hi> offering him the Chancellorship, which old P.V. Smith's death has vacated. The objection to Phil. is that he already holds 3 chancellorships â€“ York, Truro, &amp; Chester. He may find that he has no time to add a fourth.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Tony Chute</hi> went off to Hartlepool after lunch. Lionel left for a fortnight's holiday at Torquay.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Hugh Cecil</hi> has a long &amp; effective criticism of Sir Lewis Dibdin the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>. It fits in quite well with what I wrote, though it contemplates the facts from another point of view.</p>
