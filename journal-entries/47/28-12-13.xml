         <p>I worked at the Charge most of the day, bringing the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> part to some kind of a conclusion: but it is poor, half&#8211;cooked stuff! In the afternoon I walked round the Park, which seemed to be altogether deserted.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Thomas Inskip</hi> wrote to me with reference to the Trustee living of Christ Church, Felling. He seems to be aggrieved because I have not acknowledged the Trustee's Secretary's letters, announcing their intention of nominating some clergyman or other! He suggests that my known dislike of "Party patronage Trusts" may be at the root of my neglect! I wrote in reply that I had not conceived that they were seeking advice: that I never <hi rend="underline">offered</hi> advice to patrons lest I should be suspected of seeking to influence their action: &amp; that he was right in crediting me with abhorrence of the Trusts. I suspect that the "Protestant Underworld" has not yet finished with me! They will have the chance of sending a firebrand to S. Nicholas, Durham.</p>
