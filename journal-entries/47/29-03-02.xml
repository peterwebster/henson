         <p>The frost continues, but there is a feeling of thaw in the air. I wasted another morning in the vain attempt to write something about <hi rend="underline">Modernism</hi> for the "Bishoprick", but my right hand has for the present lost its cunning.</p>
         <p>I tramped round the Park in the afternoon: &amp; looked on for a while at a football match, played on a snow&#8211;covered ground. The passion for the game is unquenchable among these Northerners.</p>
         <p>In view of my intention (will it ever be carried out?) of going to Avignon after Easter, I fell to reading Creighton's account of the Popes who reigned there. It is truly a melancholy record: and not less astonishing than melancholy: for the general conscience was certainly troubled, and the most depraved part of the Christian Church was the Papacy.</p>
