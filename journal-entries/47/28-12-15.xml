         <p>There was a heavy fall of snow during the night, and the roads were in a bad state. I "cried off" attending Plummer's funeral in Sunderland, &amp; fell to clearing up my room, &amp; writing letters.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">J.G. Wilson</hi> came to tea, and I motored to Durham with him. There I called on the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; discussed appointments to the 9 vacant livings.</p>
         <p>I received a letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury conveying a suggestion from the Home Secretary, that I should consent to give evidence in favour of prohibiting "<hi rend="underline">The Well of Loneliness</hi>" as an obscene book. I did not see why I should allow my name to be associated, even in so respectable a fashion, with the nauseous subject which that notorious book deals with: and, accordingly, I wrote at once to his Grace declining the suggested procedure.</p>
