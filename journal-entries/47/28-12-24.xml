         <p>Our guests dispersed – first Lady Lawrence &amp; John, then M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Monsell &amp; Aubrey Pike, finally Archdeacon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Cornwall with Nigel.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The newspapers report that the Archbishop of Canterbury is ill. – internal inflammation</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I wrote to the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Albert Simpson, assistant&#8211;curate of Holy Trinity, Stockton, offering him appointment to Evenwood: also to the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> W.C.D. Fedden, offering him appointment to Ryton.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon Lionel and I motored to Tanfield to find out the case of the Vicar (Postle) respecting whom his mother had written to me in tragical terms. I found him comparatively sound, &amp; then went on to the Rectory, Gateshead, where I found the Rector (Stephenson) very poorly. On my return to the Castle, I had an interview with Edward Troup, the rejected Ordination candidate. I reserved my decision, promising to write to him soon. Then I wrote letters, and made preparations for the morrow.</p>
