         <p>There was a heavy snowfall during the night. I worked at the Preface, but am not yet sure that I have a workable plan for it! <hi rend="underline">Solvitur soibendo</hi>! In the afternoon I trudged through the snow to Dawson's farm, &amp; had some talk with Dawson &amp; his wife &amp; son. On my return I settled with Dick the details of the service for the consecration of his Church next week. Kenneth came to see me: he seems to be cheerful, &amp; I hope he has good grounds.</p>

<hi rend="bold">[</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Baring</hi>'s plan, in his old age at any rate, was to drive straight to a church to confirm, and go away directly afterwards, sleeping at an hotel when he could not get home, for he <hi rend="bold underline">had a profound distrust of the beds provided by the clergy</hi>. â€¦. In his last years, on the death of a Rural Dean, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Baring</hi> had allowed the office to lapse. (v. Creighton's Life i. p. 205) This is an interesting side&#8211;light on my predecessor.<hi rend="bold">]</hi>
