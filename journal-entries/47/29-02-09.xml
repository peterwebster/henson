         <p>A mild, almost springlike day. I read through the Bishop of Liverpool's article in the Liverpool Review â€“ "<hi rend="underline">Establishment &amp; Reunion</hi>", and wrote to his Lordship. It does not appear to me either strong, or wise, or even effective. </p>
         <p>I worked at the Charge, part III., but not very effectually. The beastly thing bores me!!!</p>
         <p>After lunch I walked round the Park with the dogs: and, later, had an interview with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Spedding. The "Times" has a fairly full account of Barking Church, the restoration of which is announced. Two excellent photographs strengthen the Appeal for Funds, the one showing the plaister ceiling which now exists, &amp; the other showing the oak roof which that ceiling conceals. It is to be hoped that the sacrifice of the one in order to disclose the other will not injure the admirable acoustics of the church. There is always that anxiety attaching to such restoration: &amp; so important a matter is the acoustic quality of a church, and so difficult to ensure excellence, that it is worthwhile making a considerable sacrifice of historical &amp; architectural considerations in order to secure it.</p>
