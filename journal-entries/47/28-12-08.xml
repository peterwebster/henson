         <p>I slept badly, relieving my wakefulness by reading Pollard's Henry VIII. He goes far to endorsing Froude's estimate of the king, who certainly had a much more respectable case for divorcing Catherine than is generally realized. If he had not waited so long before taking action, he would have gained his object and gone far to save his reputation.</p>
         <p>I finished section (a) of the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Part of the Charge, on <hi rend="underline">The Inherent Spiritual Authority of the Church (a). The question of Establishment</hi>.</p>
         <p>Ella &amp; Lionel accompanied me to Blaydon where I re&#8211;consecrated the peal of bells, and gave an address. Then we went to Sunderland where I met the Rector &amp; some of his Church officers in Bishopwearmouth Church. They wanted my counsel on the important question whether they should tinker up the existing building which is truly hideous, or seize the opportunity of replacing it by a really fine church. On the whole I incline to the last. After tea at the Rectory, we returned to Auckland Castle.</p>
         <p>I wrote to William.</p>
