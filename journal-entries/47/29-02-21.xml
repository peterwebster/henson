<hi rend="italic">I read through Gore's little book, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Jesus of Nazareth</hi><hi rend="italic">". It is a very characteristic production, exhibiting both the admirable excellences &amp; the grave defects' of Gore's work. He doesn't really appreciate the formidable character of the objections he claims to meet.</hi>

         <p>Cook, the parson who has had charge of Framwellgate More, lunched here. I advised him to write to Tallents about the curacy at Brandon.</p>
         <p>I motored to Bishop Middleham, &amp; called on Davison, who had been reported ill. I found him sore troubled, like the patriarch, with boils! Paero, the Chief Inspector of Ancient Monuments, arrived at tea&#8211;time.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Ryton, where I instituted Fedden to the Rectory. There was a good muster of the clergy. The Rural Dean, Jackson, came back with us as far as Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street. He is keen about the arch√¶ological treasures of his parish, and, with most praiseworthy zeal, seeks to interest the boys in the elementary school. We got back to Auckland about 9.30 p.m.</p>
