         </p>
         <p>There had been a good bit of snow during the night. Fog and slush united in a damp and cheerless day. The service in the Minster began at 2.30 p.m. and occupied nearly 2 hours. Everything went through without hitch, and the general effect was very impressive. The Archbishop's two addresses were heard, but not understood, for the acoustics of the great building are very bad, &amp; the mechanical devices, while they unquestionably increase the volume of sound, make no improvement in the clearness of the speech. After the service we (i.e. the Bishops of the Province were photographed with their new Metropolitan[)]. Then we returned to Government House &amp; had tea, after which we motored home arriving about 20 minutes before 8 o'clock.</p>
         <p>Tony Chute had arrived on a visit. He has been attending the Student Christian Movement at Liverpool.</p>
