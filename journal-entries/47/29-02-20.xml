         <p>I motored to Durham, and lunched with the High Sheriff (Forster), and the Grand Jury. There, of course, I made a foolish speech in proposing the host's health. Then I walked to Cosin's Library, and presided over a meeting of the Finance Board, which was followed by a meeting of the Conference Committee. The proceedings went on from 2.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. being woefully prolonged by that pious jackass, Lomax. Then I returned to Auckland Castle, from whence I emerged again to go to Shildon, where I confirmed 105 persons in the parish church. On the whole I was pleased, for the sexes were about equally represented in the candidates; &amp; the males included 9 ex&#8211;Service men. A considerable number of their comrades attended to witness their confirmation. Watts would be a good parson enough if he would but give up politics. In the character of a "Labour" politician, he is extravagant and absurd. I read through a very characteristic booklet, "Modern Problems of the Church", by Major.</p>
