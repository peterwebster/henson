         <p>A thaw set in, and then snow by nightfall had for the most part vanished.</p>
         <p>I finished the preface which will perhaps fill 80 pages of the printed book. It does not please me either in plan or phrase, but it will serve to embarrass my friends (if I have any left) and to occupy my foes. It is, however, quite honest, &amp;, for that reason, ought to disarm the criticism which it invites.</p>
         <p>Robin came to see me, and for an hour we had a "heart to heart" conversation. He is clearly depressed, and divided in mind, but I suspect that he has already crossed the Rubicon, and that counsel &amp; remonstrance are really belated and futile. "<hi rend="underline">Liberari animam meum</hi> [my soul to be set free]" â€“ that is all the comfort I took from our interview. I like the youth, and pity him.</p>
         <p>Ella and Lionel went to a performance of "She stoops to conquer" by the Women's Institutes, in aid of the Castle Preservation Fund.</p>
         <p>Lomax of Ferryhill lunched here, and talked with me for an hour. He is mad as a March hare, but a saint, and loveable both for his absurdity and for his goodness!</p>
