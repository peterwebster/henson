         </p>
         <p>A frost&#8211;bound country &amp; a foggy air.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 8 communicants, including Linetta. I occupied the morning by revising my sermon, and writing letters. The weather became tempestuous during the afternoon. Nevertheless I walked in the Park. </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi> went with me to West Hartlepool, where I preached at Evensong to a large congregation in Stranton Parish Church. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Carr</hi> read the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> lesson, &amp; part of the prayers very clearly &amp; modestly. He has a pleasant voice, &amp; looks good.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi> has not yet heard the result of his exam<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi>, on which turns the continuance of his career at Oxford. He is confident that he has passed, but such confidence is never a very satisfactory sign! He is extraordinarily sensitive &amp; resentful of criticism &amp; censure â€“ a consequence of coddling by his mother. I spoke kindly but firmly to him on the point, &amp; he seemed to receive my admonition very well. But, if he has failed, the question of his allocation will not be altogether easy to answer, &amp; his position will be sufficiently humiliating.</p>
