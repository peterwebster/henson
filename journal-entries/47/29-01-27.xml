         <p>A keen frost, and in the afternoon, snow. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We were 8 communicants, including Lionel and John.</p>
         <p>I worked on the Preface most of the day. I wrote to that neurotick young noodle, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gilbert Harding</hi>, who is now at Mirfield, and assures me that, "after a sharp &amp; he hopes final attack of Roman fever", he is settled in mind. I am by no means unwilling to make a present of him to the Scarlet Lady.</p>
         <p>I have done no preaching for 3 Sundays – an almost unprecedented experience. This blessed Preface has provided me with an excuse for frank abstinence from religious duties! It is on these occasions that I avail myself of the aphorism – "<hi rend="underline">Ubi episcopus, ibi ecclesia</hi>" [where is a bishop, there is the Church] – which I should not be indisposed to criticize in other connexions. How far this episcopal absenteeism from Divine Service is edifying is a question not quite easy to avoid, &amp; quite impossible to answer satisfactorily.</p>
