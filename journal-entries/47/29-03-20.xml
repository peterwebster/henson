         <p>I spent the morning in writing letters, &amp; copying them into my letter&#8211;book. It is difficult to see any adequate reason why I should be at the pains of preserving copies of my own letters, for I have nobody who will be interested in them on personal grounds, and there is no permanent value in them on any other. I walked round the Park with the dogs: &amp;, on my return to the Castle, corrected &amp; despatched some more proofs of the Charge.</p>
         <p>Lionel &amp; I motored to West Auckland, where I confirmed 85 persons in the little old church. There were an unusual number of elderly women presented. I could not but connect the fact with the Vicar's extensive distribution of cash &amp; clothes to the unemployed. It is difficult to be fair in one's analysis of the motives which lead men &amp; women to religious profession. The crowd that followed the Son of Man was collected more by the reports of His marvellous deeds, than by the truth &amp; grace that marked His speech. And undoubtedly the popular conception of the Christian Minister always associates lavish almsgiving with spiritual ministry &amp; holiness of life. The "hard Church" has little following among the poor.</p>
