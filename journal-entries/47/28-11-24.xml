<hi rend="doubleunderline">Dedication of County War Memorial</hi> –</p>
         <p>A brilliant morning after the great tempest of yesterday, though the wind is still boisterous. We motored into Durham for the function. After robing &amp; getting into order in the Chapter House, we proceeded to the memorial outside the eastern end of the Cathedral. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Londonderry</hi> – who makes a fine figure in his uniform as Lord Lieutenant – unveiled the memorial, &amp; made a short speech. Then the Dean accepted it in the name of the cathedral body: &amp; I made a short speech before dedicating the memorial. The arrangements had been admirably made by Colonel Bowes. After the National Anthem had been played three wreaths were deposited by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Londonderry</hi>, by myself, &amp; by the Chairman of the County Council. There was a considerable gathering of the public. As we returned to the Chapter House, we had to endure a smart shower of rain. We lunched with the Dean, as did also Lord Londonderry &amp; Lady Margaret his daughter, and Lord Barnard. We returned to Auckland after lunch: &amp; I walked round the Park.</p>
