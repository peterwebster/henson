         <p>I finished the Introductory Article to the volume of the Four Major Prophets, &amp; sent it to Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Cassell &amp; Co. It is poor hasty work, but in this evil time I can do no better.</p>
         <p>Some months ago a publisher, Arthur H. Stockwell Ltd, asked for some of my old sermons, which he proposed to publish in a series he was projecting under the title "The People's Pulpit". I was foolish enough to send him eight sermons, for which he volunteered to give me the munificent sum of &#x00A3;10.! This afternoon the proofs arrived.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi> asks me to stay at Lambeth for the Bishops' Meeting. It is civil of him, but I do not particularly wish to come under his roof. Yet it might well be thought churlish if I refused an invitation, which may be designed as a kind olive&#8211;branch, I mean, an indication that he desires me to remain in the inner circle: but do I desire to do so? I am divided in mind between a genuine wish to have no more to do with ecclesiastical affairs, and a feeling that it might be a failure of duty to indulge the wish.</p>
