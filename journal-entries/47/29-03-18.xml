         <p>The reports of my Address in the newspapers hardly give a true impression of its character, yet they cannot be said to be either inaccurate or unfair. I muddled away the morning in clearing up my room &amp; doing "odd jobs". Then Lesley came to see me before going into the country with his employers. Lionel &amp; I motored to Hart where I confirmed 42 candidates in the old church. Then we went to West Hartlepool, &amp; had tea with Canon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Poole, after which we went to S. Paul's, where I confirmed 140 persons. Our journey back to Auckland was delayed by fog, which made driving slow and dangerous.</p>
         <p>Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Cook's estimate for our little jaunt to France is poundign<hi rend="doubleunderline">63:3:0</hi> each. This would mean a total expenditure of not less than &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">200</hi>, which is rather more than I contemplated. And the hustlement of such frequent changes may be extremely fatiguing: &amp; with Fearne in a state of convalescence not very prudent. It is really an extremely embarrassing thing to know what to do.</p>
