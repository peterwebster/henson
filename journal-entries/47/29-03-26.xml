         </p>
         <p>A glorious spring day, but my cold still so heavy on me that could not enjoy it.</p>
         <p>The formal announcement of Bell's appointment is in the "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>". I wrote to him a letter of "congratulation". He may be a formidable rival to Temple for Canterbury. Then I prepared notes for a speech at the Prize&#8211;giving of James I's Grammar School in Bishop Auckland, and delivered it during the afternoon in the Hippodrome to a large company of boys &amp; parents. After tea with the Headmaster, I returned to the Castle feeling more decrepit than ever, the heat being rather excessive.</p>
         <p>In man or woman, but far most in man,</p>
         <p>And most of all in man that ministers</p>
         <p>And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe</p>
         <p>All affectation. 'Tis my perfect scorn:</p>
         <p>Object of my implacable disgust.</p>
         <p>So Cowper with reference to the fashionable preachers of his day. We are hardly less open to his satire now, though the modes of our affectations are different.</p>
