         <p>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. The post brought me several more letters approving my letter in the "Times". The "Times" has a communicated article on the Archbishops' Committee's Report. <hi rend="italic">It comes down decisively on the side of the Baptismal Franchise</hi>. There are also two short letters on "Matins on Sunday" both on my side. I attended Evensong. Then <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> brought in a party from the Girls' Guides' meeting: &amp; I showed them the Library. Then <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName> &amp; her daughter <persName xml:id="4225">Lady Ilchester</persName> held me talking for some while. After they had departed, I walked for an hour with : and then wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>. After dinner I played chess with Elizabeth, &amp; thus brought to an appropriate conclusion of frivolity a day which throughout its whole course had been marked by folly &amp; wastage! It would seem that the depraving influence of War (on which the 'Nation' enlarges with much selfâ€“satisfaction) is by no means confined to those who are actually engaged in waging it!</p>
