         <p>A beautiful day, bright and warm â€“ too warm for efficiency! Elizabeth returned home after staying with us for a fortnight. My residence begins today. I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong, I took <persName xml:id="437">Knowling</persName> for a walk. We visited the potato patch, where the crop was being lifted. It seems a heavy one, though the potatoes are disfigured by an unlovely scab. After tea I wrote a number of letters, &amp; paid some bills. Air raids are now nightly occurrences. <hi rend="bold underline">The demand for "reprisals" grows apace: it is now endorsed by the "Times". Thus we fall from one abomination to another.</hi>
