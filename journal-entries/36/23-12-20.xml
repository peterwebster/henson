         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8.15 a.m. when all the candidates communicated. A telegram from Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring brough the dolorous tidings of<hi rend="doubleunderline"> Brewer's</hi> death. He was only ordained a few months ago, &amp; had made an excellent start in his work. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> went off by the noontide train, and I took his place in chapel with an improvised address, on the composition of sermons. During the afternoon Moulsdale<persName xml:id="3159"></persName> and Dawson Walker<persName xml:id="3161"></persName> arrived. I delivered the Charge which I had written, but the chapel was cold, the subject unpalatable, and the speaker dispirited and distracted. Accordingly, I cannot persuade myself that the Ordinandi were edified. On the other hand, I was pleased with their demeanour during the private interviews. Without exception, they impressed me as both sincere and modest.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> motored to Windlestone, and witnessed the baptism of Sir Timothy Eden's child. There was a considerable gathering of the county.</p></body></text></TEI>
