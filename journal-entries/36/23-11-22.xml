         <p>The result of Prohibition in the United States is precisely what everyone really conversant with the history of the question expected. If the object is to close the open saloons (American euphemism <hi rend="underline">for pot&#8211;houses</hi>) it has succeeded: if it is to stop drinking it has failed and must fail just where drinking most needs suppression. In attempting to enforce it the authorities are running their heads against a stone wall.</p>

In the afternoon I walked in the Park, &amp; watched Lawes, Ashton, George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, &amp; the carter trying vainly to split up the trunk of a beech&#8211;tree. I wrote to Lord Sands and D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Wotherspoon inquiring what was the formal doctrine, &amp; what the actual practice of the Church of Scotland on the subject of Divorce.</p>
         <p>Also I sent out notices for the first meeting of the little Committee of Bishops which is charged with revising the 39 Articles. </p>
         <p>The newspapers announce the resignation of the Bishop of Ely, and the robbing of the late Bishop of Winchester, who is stated to have lost a sum of money variously stated as &#x00A3;40 and &#x00A3;4000. The lower figure probably stands for <hi rend="underline">lira.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
