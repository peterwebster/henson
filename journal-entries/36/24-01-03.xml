         <p>There was frost last night, and the weather was much colder during the day. I finished the sermon for the cathedral by lunchtime. In the afternoon I motored with our guests to High Force, hoping that there would have been a plenitude of water in the Fall: but I was disappointed, though of course 'twas a noble spectacle enough.
