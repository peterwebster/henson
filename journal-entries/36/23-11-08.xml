         <p>Sixty years of my life have passed. There cannot be many more to come. On the most optimistic view, a decade of active life remains to me. It is not a comfortable reflexion. Substantially my life has disclosed its content. I can see quite clearly that my place will be a humble one in the general record. <hi rend="underline">"I am not better than my fathers".</hi> I received gifts or letters from the little faithful group â€“ George Nimmins<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, Alfred Spelling<persName xml:id="7"></persName>, Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, Olive<persName xml:id="1686"></persName>, and of course <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName>.

Being on the sick list, I remained in my study, and did nothing more serviceable than writing letters of thanks to my Birthday correspondents, save that I had interviews with two of my clergy. I succeeded in passing on my engagement to dedicate a War&#8211;Memorial at Lyons to the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="2785"></persName>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">I read through the Report of the Lambeth Conference Committee on "The Ministry of Healing", and was much distressed at its character.</hi><hi rend="italic"> I cannot accept its "fundamental principle" viz "that the power to exercise spiritual healing [of the body] is taught by Christ to be the natural heritage of Christian people who are living in fellowship with God, &amp; is part of the ministry of Christ through His Body the Church". The Committee is mostly composed of the least authoritative Bishops.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
