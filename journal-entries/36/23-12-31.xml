         <p><hi rend="bold">New Year's Eve, December 31</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1923.</hi></p>
         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Denham</hi><persName xml:id="1462"></persName> send me a long letter in acknowledgment of my gift of a copy of "In Defence". I have not seen him since I took my degree in 1884, but during my undergraduate life we had been very intimate.</p>
         <p>A Roman Catholic priest, who describes himself as Monsignor Provost <hi rend="doubleunderline">Brown</hi>, and whom I recall as resident in Durham during my Decanate writes to me &#x00E0; propos of my letter in yesterday's "<hi rend="underline">Sunday Times"</hi>. He makes much the same point as that made by Father <hi rend="doubleunderline">Woodlock</hi><persName xml:id="5375"></persName> and I think it is a good one viz.: that continental Roman Catholics are commonly obsessed with a complete misunderstanding of the ecclesiastical situation in England, and that they are confirmed in their error by such conferences as those held at Malines.<note xml:id="544" n="1"></note></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The "Yorkshire Post" and the "Newcastle Journal" reproduce much of my article in the "Sunday Times". They are evidently puzzled at the subject. My letter "Rome and England" appeared in the "Times". I received a telegram from the Editor of the "Manchester Guardian":</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">"Much interested in your letter in today's Times on Reunion question. May we print it as letter to editor addressed to ourselves in tomorrow's issue". I replied: "By all means, publish the letter"</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi></p>
         <p>The Servant's Party was celebrated with due vigour. A little play, in which Alexander<persName xml:id="5214"></persName>, William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Smith performed, was arranged in the Dining Room, and went off very well. There is much dramatic feeling in English folk.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[106]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p>The year past has played havock among my friends. Gow<persName xml:id="216"></persName>, Murray<persName xml:id="227"></persName> and Ker<persName xml:id="22"></persName> leave gaps that can never be filled. Paula Inge<persName xml:id="2067"></persName> was my god&#8211;daughter, and might have become a comfort presently. Old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dicey<persName xml:id="403"></persName>, Prof. Bonney<persName xml:id="1862"></persName>, and Sir R. R. Simpson<persName xml:id="2523"></persName> had already ceased to mean much, though their actual disappearances tends to empty the stage of my life. The unexpected deaths of Watts Ditchfield and Emmet remove men with whom I had been associated. Brewer's sudden death last Advent takes away one of the most promising of those whom I have myself ordained. But all these losses are as nothing compared with that inflicted on me by the death of my sister. This was indeed an untoward and shattering event. My whole scheme of personal arrangements is broken up by it.</p>
         <p>In the diocese the year has been marked by an unusual number of changes in the incumbencies. I reckon up no less that 14 institutions, of which all but one took place in the parish churches. <hi rend="bold underline">These functions bring into prominence the conditions of ministry in the Church of England, and thus have some effect in discouraging the spread of Anglo&#8211;Catholicism. They also give me an opportunity of becoming personally known to the people, and that in a manner which emphasizes the episcopal office. I completed the informal visitation of the Rural deaneries which I had begun in 1922.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[107]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The statistics of confirmations are encouraging. There was an increase in the number of persons confirmed of about 1000.</hi></p>
         <p>I preached many sermons in the parish churches, of which 3 had more than ordinary interest viz:</p>
         <p>1. At Consett on March 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> after the Medomsley Colliery accident.</p>
         <p>2. At Beamish on June 10<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> in connexion with the "Educational Week"</p>
         <p>3. In Durham Cathedral on Oct 19<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> at the dedication of the Military Chapel</p>
         <p>Of the extra&#8211;diocesan sermons the following 12 were notable:</p>
         <p>1. At Penrith on March 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> at the millenary of the parish church</p>
         <p>2. At S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's Cathedral, on April 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> for S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> George's Society</p>
         <p>3. In Westminster Abbey on April 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on Prayer Book Revision</p>
         <p>4. At Scarborough on May 20<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> to the Royal Society of Public Health</p>
         <p>5. In York Minster on July 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> on the necessity of restoring fundamental harmony in the C. of E.</p>
         <p>6. In the Temple on July 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on the necessity of restoring fundamental harmony in the C. of E.</p>
         <p>7. In S. Paul's Cathedral on July 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on "Truthfulness".</p>
         <p>8. In Buckingham Palace on Nov 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on Guy Fawkes Day</p>
         <p>9. In the Chapel Royal on Nov 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on the League of Nations.</p>
         <p>10. In Westminster Abbey on Nov 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on "Protestantism"</p>
         <p>11. In the Royal Exchange on Nov 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on Armistice Day.</p>
         <p>12. In Carlisle Cathedral on Nov 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> on "The Love of Money".</p>
         <p>I find the composition of sermons ever more laborious, and spiritually unsatisfactory.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[108]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The year has been acutely and increasingly controversial, a fact of which the explanation must be sought, not in my fault, but in the disordered state of the time. Prayer book revision would in any case have compelled conflict, but the impudence and determination, which have marked the "Anglo&#8211;Catholic" Movement, have exasperated every difference. I have written several letters to the "Times":&#8211;</hi></p>
         <p>January 31<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>, April 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, June 21<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>, July 9<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, October 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, November 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, December 31<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I have also contributed Articles to the following:</hi></p>
         <p>1. The Edinburgh Review.</p>
         <p>2. The Times Literary Supplement.</p>
         <p>3. The British Weekly.</p>
         <p>4. The Spectator</p>
         <p>5. The Morning Post</p>
         <p>6. The Sunday Times</p>
         <p>7. The Nineteenth Century and After</p>
         <p>8. The Manchester Guardian</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The two articles on the "Anglo&#8211;Catholic" Conference, which I wrote for the "Morning Post" were republished with additions in the small volume, "In Defence of the English Church", (Mess</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">ers</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Hodder &amp; Stoughton), of which I caused copies to be sent to the Bishops, and the members of the House of Laity.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[109]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The "Patronage Commission" met here in September, and was useful in making personal relations with some of its members easier. We have entertained a good many visitors in the course of the year, among whom Justice Darling, Lord Emmott<persName xml:id="1246"></persName>, Lord Astor, Sydney Webb, and Bishop Cameron Mann were the most interesting.</hi></p>
         <p>We again spent our holiday in motoring from one friend's house to another. After Easter we visited Ireland, &amp; spent a week at Mountsteward with the Londonderrys<persName xml:id="2818"></persName>. By an accident, the failure of Lord Durham<persName xml:id="3462"></persName> to appear, I proposed the health of Lord Castlereagh<persName xml:id="4430"></persName> at Wynyard at a luncheon in honour of his coming of age, &amp; thus seemed more <hi rend="underline">li&#x00E9;</hi> with that family than the facts justify or prudence suggests to be desirable. However, I do certainly like them, &amp; it w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> have been quite impossible to refuse to propose the toast.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The enormous folly of the "Die&#8211;hard Tories" has carried the country into a "General Election" on the fatuous issue of Protection with the result that M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Baldwin's<persName xml:id="4118"></persName> majority has been annihilated, and a "Labour" government rendered almost unavoidable. Thus the situation within Great Britain has become highly precarious at a moment when the situation in Europe calls imperatively for the intervention of British diplomacy.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
