         <p>I attended service in the College Chapel. Johnson is getting more bowed in figure, and slower in his speech, but he reads beautifully still, &amp; is very vigorous for a man of four score. I went to S. Mary's and heard the Bampton Lecture. The preacher was one of the ablest of the resident Anglo&#8211;Catholics â€“ N. P. Williams. His sermon was clever, interesting &amp; learned. He allowed himself in some humorous versions of the Biblical Fall&#8211;legends, which made the gallery titter. I was struck by the size of the congregation. I lunched with the Spooners<persName xml:id="383"></persName>, and then returned to All Souls, where I dined quietly with mine hostess. After dinner, I went to S. Mary's, and delivered the sermon on which I had bestowed so much labour. So far as I could judge it was a total failure. The congregation was not as large as I had expected, a circumstance which may be partly explained by the chill &amp; cheerless weather. The Church was cold: the undergraduates were bored: I was myself consciously dull! It is humiliating that one should be so dependent on moods or conditions.</p>
