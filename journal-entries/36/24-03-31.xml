         <p>Here the red Cross, for still the Cross is here,</p>
         <p>Though sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,</p>
         <p>Forgets that Pride to pampered priesthood dear;</p>
         <p>Churchman and votary alike despised.</p>
         <p>Foul Superstition! Howsoe'er disguised,</p>
         <p>Idol&#8211;Saint&#8211;Virgin&#8211;Prophet&#8211;Crescent&#8211;Cross&#8211;</p>
         <p>For whatsoever symbol thou art prized.</p>
         <p>Thou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!</p>
         <p>Who from true Worship's gold can separate thy dross?</p>
         <p>"Childe Harold" II. xliv </p>

         <p>I wasted the day fruitlessly on "Byron". There never was such aridity of mind &amp; inability of expression.</p>
         <p>Birney<persName xml:id="5383"></persName> of Ferryhill came to see me, and I offered him the vacant living of Witton Park. He has been in priest's Orders less than 3 years, but was for 14 years a lay&#8211;reader. He is a good man but, of course, almost illiterate.</p>
         <p>We motored to Sunderland, where I confirmed 113 candidates in S. Ignatius' Church. This was a pleasing service for the dignified building was well filled by an attentive congregation, the clergy were friendly, and the candidates well&#8211;grown &amp; reverent.</p>
         <p>After service we returned to Auckland, arriving about 10 p.m. The Byron lecture together with the Confirmations is a blending of contradictories very grievous to the spirit.</p></body></text></TEI>
