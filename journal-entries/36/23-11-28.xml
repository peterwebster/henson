         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Nimmins</hi><persName xml:id="3571"></persName> walked with me in the Park after lunch. The ground was slippery with ice, but the air was keen and exhilarating. He goes to Java next week, &amp; does not expect to return for at least 3 years. Afterwards, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I motored to Durham, and had tea with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, who accompanied us to Gateshead, where I admitted M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Waterbury to the perpetual curacy of the Parish of the Venerable Bede. In spite of the weather &amp; the election there was a fair congregation. I was pleased to notice the presence of most of the Gateshead incumbents. There is certainly a fraternal spirit among the clergy of this rural deanery, which is probably due to Stephenson's personal influence. </p></body></text></TEI>
