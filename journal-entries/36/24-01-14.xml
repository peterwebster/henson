         <p>I can only consider Gothic art as a part of the medieval revival which distinguishes our age and seems to me as important as the revival of pagan learning in the 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century. It is the culminating point of my reactionary and contracted opinions that a Grecian building, especially a church, seems to me as great an anachronism now as an invocation of Apollo and the muses in a poem. <hi rend="underline">Quid plura</hi>?

I presided at a meeting of the Sons of the Clergy, where we voted &#x00A3;52 to the widow of poor Brewer, and &#x00A3;37:10:0 to that woeful M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Rooker. On returning to Auckland, I wrote to the Bishop of Bradford asking him whether he could find a place for the woeful curate. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> thinks, as I do, that it is not possible for him to find a place in the diocese. The curate at Hartlepool wrote to say that he was leaving the diocese because there was no prospect of "promotion"!</p></body></text></TEI>
