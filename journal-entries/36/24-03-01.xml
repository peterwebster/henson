         <p>After dictating some letters to Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, and writing such as needed the intimate suggestion of "my own hand" I motored with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> to Stockton and attended the funeral of old Sir Leonard Ropner, who died last week at the age of 86. On my return to Auckland I had interviews, first, with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> who brought me the documents connected with the purchase of the hoardings sites in Durham for signature, &amp; also brought the cheque for &#x00A3;100 contributed by the Dean &amp; Chapter: next, with Mayne Young, who has accepted the living of Stillingdon. They both stayed to tea. Hardly had I settled down to read than Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> arrived, and with his assistance the remainder of the day was frittered away! The world is not favourable to the industry of bishops!</p>
