         <p>At Witton Park it is held to be useless to have a service during the afternoon since a great football match is to be played in the field which adjoins the Church. Everywhere, save for the scanty groups who will frequent the services, the dominant thought in the minds of the people will be the thought of pleasure. The Christian Tradition will only be strong enough to give a sense of wrong to the holiday–making of the "religious public", which may, perhaps, form as much as one eighth of the population. What advantage to religion is there in this effect? If the churches were closed altogether, &amp; the last traces of a Christian observance of the Fast were obliterated, would the moral levels of popular life be lowered?</p>
         <p>We all motored to Durham for Evensong. I occupied the throne where the unaccompanied singing was heard to perfection. The choir of the cathedral has never been better. After tea with the Cruickshanks<persName xml:id="1898"></persName> I went to Bearpark accompanied by Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> and Kathleen<persName xml:id="2658"></persName>. Here I preached to a congregation which perhaps half–filled the church. The parson, Hawke, is a bachelor, and has a rather feeble manner, but he is reported to be a hard worker, and a liberal theologian. We returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
         <p>Dobson, who is taking duty at Witton park during the vacancy, stayed here, as the "hospitality" of Escombe Vicarage was intolerable! He reports much domestic friction among the officials at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aidan's College, where he is on the staff.</p></body></text></TEI>
