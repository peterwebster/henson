         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. in the Chapel. During the morning I worked at my address for the Diocesan Conference. Then we motored into Durham, where I lunched with the High Sheriff, &amp; proposed his health. Then I went to the Castle and had an interview with the young man, Griffith, whom the Vicar of Pelton would have as a deacon. This I will not allow, as I judge Pelton in present circumstances to be unsuitable. I told him that, if he passed the examination, I would find him a title. Then we attended Evensong in the Cathedral, which ended, I returned to Auckland in a snow&#8211;storm.</p>
         <p>I attended a meeting of the Wear Valley Lodge, &amp; witnessed William's<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> initiation as a Freemason. The Brethren elected me an honorary member of the Lodge, a compliment which, in the circumstances, I could not refuse. There were about 60 members present, &amp; the proceedings were conducted with gravity. I could not but ask myself where any church in the place could call together so many men, or inspire them with such evident interest. The tone of the formulations is admirable, &amp; if the language must appear to a cultivated mind stilted and even bombastic, this is a circumstance which is not likely to disturb the good tradesmen who belong to the Craft. <hi rend="bold underline">On the whole Freemasonry makes for good</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
