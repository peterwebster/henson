         <p>The Government is in a minority of about 90: &amp; the question is necessarily raised. <hi rend="bold underline">Who will govern the country? It is impossible not to compassionate the unhappy Prime Minister</hi><persName xml:id="4118"></persName><hi rend="bold">. </hi>Placed in office by an almost unprecedented act of party faith, <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Baldwin</hi>, against the advice of the most trusted chiefs of his party, has forced a General Election in which the party has been overwhelmed. What title to continued confidence can he claim?</p>
