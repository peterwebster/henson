         <p>I decided to send in notice that on the meeting of the <hi rend="bold underline">Convocation in York</hi> on February 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, I would move the following Resolution in the Upper House:&#8211;</p>
         <div type="quote">
         <p><hi rend="italic">"That this House, taking account of the Archbishop of Canterbury's declaration that "conversations" on the subject of "Reunion" have taken place at Malines, with his Grace's "official cognizance" and "full encouragement" between the representatives of the Churches of England and Rome; and that, in his Grace's belief, "it is impossible to doubt that further conversations must follow from the careful talks already held", respectfully requests his Grace the President to represent to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, that, before such "further conversations" take place, it is desirable to remove the wide&#8211;spread apprehension which has been created in the public mind, by making sure that the Roman Church no longer maintains its official condemnation of Anglican Orders as totally null &amp; void, and has accepted the basis of Reunion set forth in the sixth section of the Appeal issued by the last Lambeth Conference".</hi></p>
