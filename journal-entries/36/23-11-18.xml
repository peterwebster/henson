         <p>I attended Mattins in the Cathedral, and received the Holy Sacrament. At 3 p.m. there was a meeting of the League of Nations Union in one of the Theatres. The Mayor presided, &amp; the attendance was considerable. I made a speech which sounded dull, &amp; seemed ineffective: but I was politely assured that it was <hi rend="underline">neither</hi>. At Evensong I preached in the Cathedral to what was said to be an unusually large congregation, but I do not think, on a liberal estimate, there could have been more than 300 people. Something had gone wrong with the heating apparatus so that the temperature was Arctic.</p>
         <p>I had some to talk with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Quick</hi> about the Abp. Of C. whom for a while he served as chaplain. He said that <hi rend="underline">his Grace was wholly destitute of any interest in abstract truth.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
