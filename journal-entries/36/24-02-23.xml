         <p>The post brought me a letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Foakes&#8211;Jackson</hi><persName xml:id="3566"></persName> in which he describes a literary venture on which he is embarking, and invites my cooperation: but I have neither the time nor the will for anything of the kind. I motored to Darlington, and caught a train which left at 10.34 a.m. and <hi rend="bold underline">brought me to Oxford</hi> at 4.35 p.m. changing at Banbury with half an hour's wait. I went at once to All Souls, where a kindly reception awaited me.</p>
         <p>Pember's<persName xml:id="66"></persName> father was keenly interested in the Byronic Mystery, and had books on the subject. Frank was able to produce two editions of Lord Lovelace's "Astarte", and a book on the unhappy young woman Medora Leigh who was thought by some to be Byron's daughter. ("Medora Leigh" a history and an Autobiography, edited by Charles Mackay, R. Bentley, 1869.) Also I read through a short biography of Lord Lovelace by his widow. From this it appears that he was a very odd young man, very oddly nurtured mainly by his grandmother, Lady Byron, who, in order to guard him against any risk of reproducing his famous God&#8211;father's faults, subjected him to a thoroughly cranky up&#8211;bringing with the result that he grew up a strange man. He conceived himself under an honourable obligation to guard his grand&#8211;dame's memory against the libellous representations of L<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Byron's admirers and advocates.</p></body></text></TEI>
