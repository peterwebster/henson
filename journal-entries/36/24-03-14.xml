The weather is milder, &amp; indeed almost spring&#8211;like. Today the miners are deciding whether they will accept the terms proposed by the Masters. It is a new thing, I imagine, that the employers should make an offer in advance of the conflict, and, if as is said to be the present case, the offer is generous, it ought to prevent the conflict, &amp; promote better feeling.
