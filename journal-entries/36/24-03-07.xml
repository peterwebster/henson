         <p>It is colder than ever. I completed the Address for tomorrow's conference, which deals almost exclusively with two subjects viz: the reason for, and the remedy for, the shortage of Ordination candidates, and the threatened Coal strike. There is little to be said on either subject which is worth saying, but neither can well be ignored.</p>
         <p>I motored to New Seaham, and confirmed 219 candidates, of whom nearly a half were males. They were altogether drawn from a mining population.</p></body></text></TEI>
