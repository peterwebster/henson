         <p>Although I am not ignorant that many men well reputed have embraced the thrifty opinion of that Disciple, who thought all to be wasted that was bestowed on Christ in that sort, and that it were much better bestowed upon Him in the poor, yet with an eye perhaps that themselves w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be his quarter&#8211;almoners, notwithstanding I must confess it c<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> never sink into my heart, that in proportion of reason, the allowance for the furnishing out of the Service of God sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be measured by the scant &amp; strict rule of mere necessity….

         <p>I finished the Address for the Diocesan Conference. After an early lunch I motored to Easington Colliery and consecrated a part of the new cemetery. Then I went to Easington, &amp; consecrated an addition to the churchyard. Finally I went to Blackhall, &amp; consecrated a part of the new cemetery. After these three functions I returned to Auckland. The weather has become chilly &amp; wet. A feeling of winter is in the air.</p></body></text></TEI>
