         <p>The Church of Rome kept the rule of faith entire, until that rule was changed and altered by the Council of Trent; and from that time it seemed to him a matter of necessity to come out of the Church of Rome, that so that Church which is true &amp; called out from thence might follow the word of God.</p>

         <p>The "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>" has a long obituary of old <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dean Wace</hi><persName xml:id="212"></persName>, who died yesterday at the great age of 87.

         <p>The Appeal for the starving folk in Germany appeared in the papers &#8211; conspicuously in the "<hi rend="underline">Manchester Guardian</hi>", obscurely in the "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>". It was altogether absent from the columns of the "<hi rend="underline">Yorkshire Post</hi>"!</p></body></text></TEI>
