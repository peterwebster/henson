         <p>As to friendship, it is a propensity in which my genius is very limited. I do not know the <hi rend="underline">male</hi> human being, except Lord Clare, the friend of my infancy, for whom I feel any thing that deserves the name. All my other are men&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;world friendships. I did not even feel it for Shelley, however much I admired and esteemed him: so that you see not even vanity could bribe me into it, for, of all men, Shelley thought highest of my talents, <hi>â€“</hi> and, perhaps, of my disposition.</p>

         <p>I wrote a letter of condolence to Sir Henry Craik<persName xml:id="344"></persName> whose wife's death was reported in yesterday's "Times". For the rest, the day was without any unusual feature. I worked at the charge for the Ordinandi, read the papers, wrote my letters, and read more of Byron's correspondence. Also, I read through a quaint little book, at once acute and unbalanced, bigoted and liberal "<hi rend="underline">Prayer Book Revision and Christian Reunion. Some essentials discussed in the light of liturgical facts &amp; principles</hi>" by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Francis C. Eeles</hi>. The "essentials" appear to be the adoption of the Sarum ceremonial rather than the Roman, and the substitution of mortar&#8211;boards &amp; surplices for birettas &amp; cottas! The writer uses the fiercest language against the Anglo&#8211;Catholics who favour the last! Now did you <hi rend="underline">ever</hi>?</p></body></text></TEI>
