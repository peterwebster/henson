Bircham is probably incensed at not being appointed to the Rural Deanery, but he is too rude and secular. Cosgrave<persName xml:id="5313"></persName> proposed a Rider calling for more aid to the Central Fund, which was defeated, I had lunch with Cruickshank<persName xml:id="1898"></persName>, &amp; tea with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, with whom I stayed until it was time to go to the Castle for dinner. Ellershaw<persName xml:id="3459"></persName> and Wilson entertained the Judges – Roche<persName xml:id="5462"></persName> &amp; Commissioner Radcliffe – in Hall, &amp; I dined as Wilson's guest. It was a pleasant company, &amp; there was much pleasant conversation.
