         <p>Old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Stokoe loses no time in his benefaction.

I thought it judicious to send the money to the Board of Finance to be held by it until I actually require it.</p>
         <p>The Papers are filled with the election Reports. It is evident that the Government has been badly beaten, and that the Labour party will remain in the place of "the Opposition". The re&#8211;united Liberals have gained seats, but far fewer than they expected. The nation will not be "stampeded" out of Free Trade. There must be distress and disgust in the Tory camp.</p></body></text></TEI>
