These were presented from the two parishes â€“ S Luke's and Holy Trinity. I was pleased with the demeanour both of the candidates and the congregation. Also I saw with satisfaction that Warth gave to his candidates so comparatively harmless a Communion book as Walsham How's<persName xml:id="5374"></persName>.</p></body></text></TEI>
