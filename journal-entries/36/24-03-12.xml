         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I worked at the Edinburgh Article</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>After lunch I motored to Durham, &amp; saw Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> to whom I gave my assent to the terms proposed by the County Council in the matter of the new road. Then I went on to Fatfield where I confirmed 96 candidates, &amp; had tea with the octogenarian vicar, Reenan. After this, I motored to Birtley, and confirmed privately a mother &amp; daughter in a small house. I continued my journey to Gateshead, where I confirmed 180 candidates in Holy Trinity Church. The vicar, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Kitterick, looks very ill and overworked. After the service I returned to Auckland, arriving about 9.45 p.m.</p>
         <p>The best&#8211;fed &amp; best&#8211;turned out candidates were the boys of the Industrial School, who, of course, are maintained at the public expense. In spite of the dole, many of the children looked pinched and undersized.</p></body></text></TEI>
