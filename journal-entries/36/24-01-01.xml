         <p>We should be wroth in such a case; but thou</p>

         <p>The New Year made its start in spring&#8211;like weather, for a rapid thaw had set in during the night, and the sun shone upon a green landscape. My letter appeared prominently on the front page of the "<hi rend="underline">Manchester Guardian</hi>". In the "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>" there is a letter from the Bishop of Down objecting to the Malines Conference on the ground that it was incompatible with the position taken up by the Lambeth Conference. I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Charles Darling</hi> congratulating him on his elevation to the peerage, which is announced this morning. </p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Arthur Smith</hi> &amp; his wife arrived on a visit to the Castle. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fawkes</hi><persName xml:id="1082"></persName> write to say that my <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> letter was "really splendid". That will not be the judgement of the Archbishop and his champions!</p></body></text></TEI>
