         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I worked at the Edinburgh Article all the morning</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> After lunch I motored into Durham, and after trying on my new cassock at Gray's shop, went to Cosin's Library, and presided at a meeting of the Diocesan Conference Committee. I returned to Auckland for tea, after which I set out again in the motor, and went to Heworth, where I confirmed 79 persons. During the laying&#8211;on of hands a Litany of the Holy Ghost was sung softly by the choir and congregation. The effect was, I think, edifying, and must have helped the candidates through what is commonly a rather trying interval. After service we returned to Auckland.</p></body></text></TEI>
