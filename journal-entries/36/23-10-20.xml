         <p>Twenty one years ago on this day <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I plighted our troth in Westminster Abbey. The world had a more cheerful outlook then than it has now. <hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to that unhappy Harold<persName xml:id="113"></persName> suggesting that he should see me at the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> next week.</hi></p>
         <p>After lunch we all motored into Durham for the dedication of the Military Chapel in the Cathedral. The function was very stately and impressive. I preached the sermon that I wrote yesterday, dedicated the Chapel, &amp; pronounced the Blessing. Lord Durham<persName xml:id="3462"></persName> was unable to be present, his place being taken by <hi rend="bold underline">Lord Londonderry<persName xml:id="2818"></persName>, who made a short </hi>and well phrased speech from the chancel step. After tea in the Deanery, we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The Bishop of Carlisle (Williams) with his wife</hi> &amp; niece arrived at the Castle. They came in their car which was driven by the young lady.</p></body></text></TEI>
