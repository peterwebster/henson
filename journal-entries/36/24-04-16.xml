         <p>Lord, what a change within us one short hour</p>
         <p>Spent in thy presence will prevail to make,</p>
         <p>What heavy burdens from our bosoms take,</p>
         <p>What parch&euml;d grounds refresh, as with a shower!</p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">We kneel, and all around us seems to lower:</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">We rise, and all, the distant and the near,</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">Stands forth in sunny outline, brave and clear:</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">We kneel how weak, we rise how full of power,</hi></p>
         <p>Why therefore should we do ourselves this wrong</p>
         <p>Or others â€“ that we are not always strong,</p>
         <p>That we are ever overborne with care,</p>
         <p>That we should ever weak or heartless be,</p>
         <p>Anxious or troubled, when with us is prayer,</p>
         <p>And joy and strength and courage are with Thee?</p>
         <p>Archbishop Trench</p>

         <p>I suppose the experience described in these lines is integral to a sincere profession of Christianity. It is certain that the assurance of Divine guidance which it expresses has often been connected with the most woefully mistaken action.</p>
