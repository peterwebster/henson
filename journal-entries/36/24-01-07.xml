         <p>A mine's beneath a moor</p>
         <p>Acres of moor roof fathoms of mine</p>
         <p>Which diamonds dot where you please to dig;</p>
         <p>Yet who plies spade for the bright and big?</p>
         <p>Your product is &#8211; truffles, you hunt with a pig!</p>
         <p>Since bright &amp; big, when a man would dine, </p>

         <p>I received an interesting letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Foakes Jackson</hi><persName xml:id="3566"></persName>, written from the Union Theological Seminary in New York. <hi rend="bold underline">He says that his collaboration with Lake<persName xml:id="3172"></persName> has come to an end, &amp; that Lake will probably go on alone &amp; finish the work</hi>, <hi rend="underline">"but he is in great request as a preacher in Unitarian Churches all over the country &amp; preaching &amp; serious study are incompatible especially with American railway journeys". Foakes Jackson says that he "is now in the midst of a controversy about the "Virgin birth", and the bishops are trying to get out of a heresy trial and the Modernists to force one on"</hi>. That is precisely in a less acute form the situation here.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to the incriminated culprit withdrawing his license as a stipendiary curate, &amp; to his Vicar informing him of the fact.</hi></p>
         <p>I wrote to my Godson, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Herbert Nicholson</hi><persName xml:id="2285"></persName>, sending him &#x00A3;5, to buy himself a wedding present.</p></body></text></TEI>
