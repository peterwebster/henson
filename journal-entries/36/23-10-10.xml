         <p>A letter from <hi rend="underline">Hodder &amp; Stoughton</hi> informs me that the material sent to them would make about 100 pages if set up in the style of Zanzibar's<persName xml:id="3469"></persName> pamphlet which consists of 36 pages. They tell me that "it w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> not be possible for us to issue the work at one shilling", and proceed to suggest that it might be issued at 5/net in a permanent form. Now this is altogether contrary to my design in publishing anything. I wrote in reply that I desired that the price should be low enough to make purchase reasonably probable: that 5/. was quite excessive: that 2/. or 2/6 was the limit. It is all very annoying.</p>
         <p>The Emmots<persName xml:id="1246"><persName xml:id="2228"></persName></persName> &amp; Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> came with me to Durham, where I instituted clergy, and, after lunching with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, presided at a meeting of the Finance Board. The secretary reported an ominous drop in the subscriptions owing to the economic depression. I had tea in my rooms with the Emmots, Fearne &amp; Wilson. After looking over the Castle we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>An odd guy of a female missionary from China came for the night. She is a "deputation" from the C.M.S to address a meeting in the drawing room tomorrow. I myself shall be happily absent. Missionary meetings are not exactly "in my line".</p></body></text></TEI>
