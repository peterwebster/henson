         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The Bishop&#8211;designate went off at 10.30 a.m</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>Before his departure I had a final talk with him. I warned him against the ruin of most evangelical Evangelicals â€“ an unthinking acquiescence in procedures intrinsically indefensible, by which they gained the adulation of "Anglo&#8211;Catholicks", but not only forfeited their liberty of action but also damaged their credit.

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in Carissima's<persName xml:id="76"></persName> room. Then I "mooned away" the time in my room, to which the rain confined me.

He is an affectionate lad, &amp; my connexion with him when he was a choir boy at Durham &amp; when I was Dean seems to have left a great impression on his mind. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Then he dreamed of taking Holy Orders, but his intention evaporated before the insistence on regular Confession which he encountered at his Confirmation</hi><hi rend="italic">.

I was foolish enough to yield to his request for a photograph! After his departure I tried to put together some notes for the Westminster Sermon, but with very slight measure of success.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
