         <p>I wrote many letters, &amp; made some further notes for Convocation. Then I motored to Sunderland, and formally opened a Pageant &amp; Exhibition of Missions in a Dissenting Chapel. I returned to Durham, &amp; had an interview in the Castle with a Sectary who wanted me to assist a movement for setting up a memorial for Richard Baxter in Christ Church, Newgate street, where he is buried. <hi rend="bold underline">I promised to preach on December 8</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> which is the anniversary of his death.</hi> I travelled to York, &amp; put up at Bishopthorpe. After dinner there was some conversation among the Bishops on the subject of Malines, but nothing was settled. <hi rend="bold underline">Rather to my surprise Lang scouted the notion of the "conversations" at Malines being broken off, and evidently desired that my resolution should not be abandoned.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
