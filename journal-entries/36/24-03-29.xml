         <p>It is difficult to say whether hereditary right, or popular choice, produce the worse Sovereigns. The Roman Consuls make a goodly show, but then they only reigned for a year, &amp; were under a sort of personal obligation to distinguish themselves. It is still more difficult to say which form of Government is the <hi rend="underline">worst</hi> â€“ all are so bad. As for democracy, it is the worst of the whole: for what is (in fact) democracy? an Aristocracy of Blackguards.</p>

The step from Wesleyanism to the Church is not a long one.</p></body></text></TEI>
