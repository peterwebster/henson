         <p>O God, for as much as without thee we are not able to please thee; Mercifully grant, that thy Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts; through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

         <p>I put together some notes for the Address – it cannot properly be called a sermon – which I must give at the institutions. Both S. Helen's, Auckland, and Seaham Harbour are mining parishes, and I must try to say something relevant to the lives of pitmen. Davison comes of pitmen stock; and has, I think, himself in his boyhood worked in a pit. He is the best of the pitmen&#8211;parsons I know.</p>
         <p>The quaint old church of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Helen's was well filled at 10.30 a.m. when after shortened Mattins, I preached and instituted the new Vicar. Archdeacon Derry<persName xml:id="3688"></persName> inducted him, &amp; then there followed a Celebration of the Holy Communion. Nearly 200 persons communicated mostly young men &amp; women. It was a moving &amp; hope&#8211;inspiring spectacle. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> returned with me to lunch at the Castle.</p>
         <p>We (i.e. Wilson, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> &amp; I) motored to Seaham Harbour, and there I instituted the new Vicar, Rev. C. R. Appleton<persName xml:id="5366"></persName>, to the charge of that benefice. There was a considerable congregation: the service was reverent &amp; impressive: both the parson and people seemed to be taking to one another very comfortably. </p></body></text></TEI>
