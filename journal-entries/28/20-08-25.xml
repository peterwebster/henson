         <p>I had a sleepless night, &amp; was disturbed by cat which climbed on to my bed, &amp; made demonstrations. It was thrust from the room against its will! I wrote letters after breakfast, and then returned to Hereford. In the car on our way into York, I consulted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi><persName xml:id="130"></persName> about my going to Sweden in the circumstances created by the strike. He thought that, if there is a strike, there will be serious trouble until the end of September. He agreed that it w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> have an unfortunate effect if I sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be absent then, &amp; advised my returning directly from Sweden. I reached the palace about 6. 30 p.m. Alan Radford<persName xml:id="3885"></persName> with his wife<persName xml:id="1204"></persName>, son<persName xml:id="3886"></persName>, &amp; a small girl, arrived.</p>
