         <p>I gathered as much information as I could from M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> De Vere, Maish<persName xml:id="5213"></persName> the domestic chaplain, &amp; Miss Bothamly<persName xml:id="4139"></persName>, the secretary, but that information was both vague and disconcerting. We went over the Castle, and gardens. They are on a scale of feudal magnificence, and mock the narrow means of a modern bishop. <hi rend="italic">I shall live in Auckland, if I manage to live at all, as a ruined hidalgo of ancient lineage &amp; historic name in the vast &amp; crumbling palace of his ancestors! The dignity and exceeding beauty of the Chapel impressed me greatly, but over everything, within &amp; without, is written 'Ichabod'.</hi></p>
