         <p>This was a busy day. We left Botton Hall at 10.00 a.m. &amp; motored to Auckland Castle.

Then we went to Benwell Tower, where we stayed the night with the Bishop of Newcastle<persName xml:id="1980"></persName>, and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi>Wilde. Ralph<persName xml:id="427"></persName>, Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName>, &amp; Crawford<persName xml:id="4597"></persName> were here, and also the Chaplain of the Fleet.</p>
