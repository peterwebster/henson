         <p>A great pile of letters of congratulation, and, so far, only one rude postcard! It is really rather a wonderful experience, and almost makes me terrified. Here is (as far as appears) an impressive unanimity of regret at my approaching departure from Hereford. There in Durham is an extraordinary outburst of joy at my approaching return to that diocese. I may claim that my call to that episcopate is the acclamation of the people, as was S. Ambrose's.</p>
