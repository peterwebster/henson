         <p>We arrived in Stockholm about 8 a.m., and were met at the station by a messenger from the British Legation, &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Williams </hi>the chaplain. A note from the Hon: <hi rend="doubleunderline">Patrick Ramsay</hi><persName xml:id="5305" display="no"></persName> invited us to lunch on Thursday. Rooms had been taken for us in the Grand Hotel, which is finely placed on the quay &amp; faces the Royal Palace. </p>
         <p>We spent the morning in "shaking down", and the afternoon in writing letters. I wrote 1) to Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName>, 2) to old Collins, 3) to William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>. <hi rend="bold">[</hi>Also I read aloud to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> the Lecture on "Episcopacy", and corrected some typing errors.<hi rend="bold">]</hi></p>

Everywhere the ships are discharging wood neatly cut for firing, &amp; the carts are transporting it to the houses. <hi rend="underline">There is also a slight but perceptible nip of winter in the air</hi>.</p>
