         <p><hi rend="bold">[</hi>Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> came to see me at 11 a.m. Then we went into Newcastle, &amp; made various arrangements incidental to our departure in the afternoon e.g. I got my hair cut &amp;c. Then we returned to Benwell Tower &amp; lunched. <hi rend="bold underline">We packed, &amp; went to the steamer accompanied by Crawford Inge<persName xml:id="4597"></persName> and Patrick Wild<persName xml:id="5226"></persName>.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Bishop of Newcastle<persName xml:id="1980"></persName> is much perturbed by the untoward event which befell last week </hi><hi rend="italic underline">when his car ran over &amp; killed a small boy. The poor little fellow (8 1/2 years) rushed out suddenly from behind a tram, &amp; was immediately slain though the chauffeur stopped his car with the utmost promptitude</hi><hi rend="italic">. The tram&#8211;conductor, who witnessed the accident, bore conclusive testimony to the chauffeur's conduct, &amp; the boy's father declared himself convinced on the point. The bishop was much moved by a letter which he had received from the mother, conceived in a heart&#8211;broken strain but very dignified &amp; magnanimous. "The business has taught me one thing", observed the father, a joiner, "and that is that the bishop is a good man". This, perhaps, is worth something.</hi></p>
