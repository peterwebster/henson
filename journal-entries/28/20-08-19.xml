         <p>A brilliant morning, and fine weather most of the day, but as the afternoon drew towards evening, the temperature fell, &amp; I was glad to have a fire lighted after dinner in my study. The "Times" has an extract from my brief letter to the diocese headed "Bishop Henson &amp; his Palace". It reads, perhaps more like the announcement of an actual intention on my part <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to live at Auckland than I had desired, for my mind is really uncertain on the point. If I possibly can, I certainly will go into the Castle: but I will not, if I can avoid it, get into an impossible position at the very start of my episcopate.</p>
