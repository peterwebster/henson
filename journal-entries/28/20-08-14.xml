         <p>"<hi rend="underline">Yesterday, August 13</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline"> 1920, the English Revolution began</hi>."<note xml:id="513" n="1"></note> â€’ that was my observation after reading the newspaper this morning. A power has arisen outside of Parliament which openly claims to direct the policy of the nation, &amp; is avowedly acting in concert with a foreign power against the constitutional government of the country. <hi rend="bold underline">Organised labour representing a minority of the nation claims to dictate the foreign policy of the Empire: &amp; threatens "direct action" to enforce its claim</hi><note xml:id="513" n="1"></note>. The loathing of War, which has been created in the public mind during the last five years, predisposes many to condone any action which averts War, who naturally would have no part in movements of revolution. But no considering man can mistake the nature of last night's proceedings. England has ceased to be a constitutional monarchy, &amp; is making its first advance towards "the dictatorship of the proletariat".</p>
