         <p>I wrote to <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> urging her to arrange with Arthur<persName xml:id="3128"></persName> to attend the Enthronement in Durham Cathedral. We left Hereford by a train which was stated to start at 11.27 a.m., but did not start until 11.50 a.m. We travelled with several tiresome changes, but without discomfort, to York, where we arrived about 6 p.m. I was chagrined to discover that I could not "stop off" with my ticket to Darlington, &amp; had therefore to sacrifice the part from York to Darlington. We were kindly received by the Dean<persName xml:id="4346"></persName> &amp; his family.</p>
