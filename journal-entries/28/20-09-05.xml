         <p>We went to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Chad's at 8.a.m, and received the Holy Communion. After service Dorothea<persName xml:id="2768"></persName> shewed us where Christopher<persName xml:id="4721"></persName> is buried. <hi rend="bold">[</hi>I fear that wound doesn't heal.<hi rend="bold">]</hi> I went with Godfrey<persName xml:id="2685"></persName> &amp; John to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Mary's, &amp; walked behind the Mayor in procession. A new reredos &amp;c has just been set up in the church as a war memorial. After service the whole municipal body stood round a table, on which whisky, sherry, &amp; biscuits were set out. We drank the health of the King, the Mayor, and the Sheriff, &amp; then dispersed.</p>
         <p>The weather, having settled down to steady rain, we remained indoors. Godfrey read through the lecture on The Lambeth Conference<orgName xml:id="114"></orgName>, &amp; made some suggestions. On the whole he expressed approval.</p>
         <p>After dinner, we had a great discussion on the Prohibition question. Both Godfrey &amp; Dorothea would 'with but little persuasion' become Prohibitionists. I hardly know which is the most embarrassing situation for a modern bishop, to be the solitary drinker of alcohol at dinner as host, or as guest. In my own house the first, in other people's house the last is my familiar character. There is something piquant about the spectacle of the last champion of alcohol being a Christian minister! The tax collector may effect what the controversialists cannot succeed in effecting, for alcohol is certainly expensive, whatever be the truth about its lawfulness for Christians, or its wholesomeness for anybody. I shall feel humiliated when I have to range myself with Stiggins &amp; Co!</p>
