         <p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, July 21</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1920.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">[I walked from 9 Vale Avenue to the Athenaeum</hi><orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> in 45 minutes.<hi rend="bold">]</hi> After writing some letters I walked to Lambeth. We did not make much progress today. There are signs that the truce between the factions is breaking down. However, we managed to get through the day without an open breach. <hi rend="bold underline">I think the Committee realizes that I am the leader of the "Protestant" cause</hi>. The 4 Archbishops ‒ Armagh<persName xml:id="1361"></persName>, Melbourne<persName xml:id="5215"></persName>, Sydney<persName xml:id="3283"></persName>, &amp; Rupertsland<persName xml:id="2933"></persName> ‒ support me pretty steadily. The Bishops of Zanzibar<persName xml:id="3469"></persName>, Salisbury, Nassau, &amp; S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Alban's<persName xml:id="1602"></persName> are recognised as the "Anglo&#8211;Catholick" zealots. The Bishop of Chelmsford<persName xml:id="2462"></persName> has so far made no figure in the discussions, and the Bishop of Manchester<persName xml:id="242"></persName> fails to do himself justice. <persName xml:id="130">Lang</persName> is a good chairman, &amp; Nickson<persName xml:id="2533"></persName> does his duty as secretary excellently.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[</hi>I went to Sir Frank Colyer<persName xml:id="4740"></persName>, &amp; then motored to Vale Avenue. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I dined with Canon<persName xml:id="3581"></persName> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Barnes<persName xml:id="4717"></persName>. There were the Bishop of Oxford<persName xml:id="602"></persName> &amp; his wife, Lord<persName xml:id="3687"></persName> &amp; Lady Buckmaster, Sir Reginald Acland<persName xml:id="5247"></persName>, &amp; an unknown lady. The conversation ranged over many subjects, but left no clear recollections. Buckland impressed me as a fanatick, honest, perhaps, but purblind &amp; underbred. Like all the Liberals he speaks with a curious bitterness about politics domestic &amp; foreign. The rain was falling heavily when we left Westminster about 10.30 p.m. but we managed to find places in an omnibus &amp; got home very easily.<hi rend="bold">]</hi></p>
