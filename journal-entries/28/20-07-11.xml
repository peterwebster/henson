         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I went to the Cathedral at 8 a.m., &amp; received the Holy Communion together. That completed my church&#8211;going, for I spent the day, save for lunch when I returned to the Deanery, preparing some observations for the Committee, &amp; writing letters in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>. As I walked down the Embankment I fell in with the Bishop of Edinburgh and Athelstan Riley<persName xml:id="213"></persName>. The last was very full of the discovery that "Rome is winning"! I asked him whether he w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Romanize the English Church to meet the mischief. He is evidently feeling rather "left out in the cold", since the newer type of sacerdotalist has left him &amp; his Tractarians &amp; Gallicans far behind.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Newcastle<persName xml:id="1980"></persName> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Wild<persName xml:id="1981"></persName> were at lunch. Also M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Gabrielsson<persName xml:id="1314" display="no"></persName>, who has a scholarship to examine the question of Reunion.</p>
         <p>I wrote to George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, &amp; Sanday<persName xml:id="359"></persName>. I asked the old Saint to leave Zanzibar's<persName xml:id="3469"></persName> silly book alone. Also I wrote to Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName>. <hi rend="bold underline">The Bishop of Coventry<persName xml:id="2047"></persName> gave me a paternal admonition on the subject of my "sarcasm" in the Conference<orgName xml:id="114"></orgName>! He may be right, &amp; sarcasm is always a perilous weapon</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p>
