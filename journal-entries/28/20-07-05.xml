         <p>A woefully wet day. I went to Lambeth, and spent the day in the Conference<orgName xml:id="114"></orgName>. It was distinctly dull, &amp;, I should think, not very serviceable. In the morning we discussed the League of Nations: and in the afternoon, spiritualism, Christian science, &amp; theosophy. The speeches were, for the most part, very disappointing. I had tea in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, where I found Headlam<persName xml:id="552"></persName>, who is evidently pleased with the reception of his Bampton Lectures. Burge<persName xml:id="602"></persName> dined at 16 Elvaston Place, &amp; was very entertaining. <hi rend="bold">[</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Cecil<persName xml:id="31"></persName>, Pearce<persName xml:id="636"></persName>, &amp; I are agreed in thinking that he must go to Lambeth when Davidson<persName xml:id="128"></persName> retires</hi>.<hi rend="bold">]</hi> He is evidently very happy at Cuddesdon, where the relief from evening functions has given him a new lease of life.</p>
