         <p>I dressed, &amp; descended to my study in the course of the afternoon. A terrific thunderstorm was proceeding while I dressed. The Dean<persName xml:id="5128"></persName> most kindly undertook to address the Girl Guides in my stead. I could not of course attend the great Masonic gathering in the Town Hall, but the late Dean, who is putting up with us, was not deterred by the weather from attending. Cecil Fortescue<persName xml:id="4760"></persName> visited me in the course of the afternoon. He might do for one of the Tyne&#8211;side parishes. He certainly is woefully ill&#8211;placed in a tiny country parish. There were some more letters of congratulation, but far fewer than, perhaps, might have been expected. </p>
