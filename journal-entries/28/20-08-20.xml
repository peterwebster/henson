         <p><hi rend="bold">[</hi>I worked (but vainly) at the lectures. Then we motored to Mordiford and lunched with the [sic] <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> "cousins".

This morning at 8 a.m. we made a start ‒ a tiresome &amp; silly performance, also almost certainly futile, for <hi rend="underline">no</hi> painter not of the first magnitude ‒ a Rembrandt or a Sargent ‒ could make my face into a tolerable picture! However, even a daub in a series of official portraits is better than a gap: and the picture will not, in the worst event, be markedly inferior to the squalid representation of former Bishops of Hereford in the dining&#8211;room.</p>
