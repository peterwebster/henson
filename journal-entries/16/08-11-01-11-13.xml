         <p>A dull morning threatening fog. <persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m. &amp; I assisted. There were 34 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>For my text I have taken the words from Heb: XII.2, '<hi rend="underline">Looking unto Jesus, the Author &amp; Perfector of (our) Faith</hi>'. The omission of the pronoun, as in the Greek, suggests the line of my preaching. Christ was on earth as the pattern Believer, the Leader &amp; Consummator of Faith.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">Knox told me that the flowers on the Altar were a thank offering from an old flower–selling woman to whom we gave free of charge her birth certificate, when she claimed her pension</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>There was a large congregation in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi></orgName> at 11 a.m: &amp; on the whole the sermon was well listened to.  No less than 133 persons remained to the Holy Communion, at which I myself was the celebrant.  A telegram from <persName xml:id="1846" display="no">Frank Smith</persName> was brought to me in the vestry before service saying that <persName xml:id="584">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dennistoun</persName> was 'still unconscious'.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the Church was quite full. I preached on I.Cor. I.2, 'called to be saints'. The 'Te Deum' was sung after service. The offertory was nearly £8.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>, <persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>, <persName xml:id="630">Bob</persName>, <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="122">Hine–Haycock</persName> came in to supper.   </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[384]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Monday, a letter from <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> told me that her father still lay unconscious: and this was followed by a telegram announcing his death last night.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The <ref xml:id="266">'Times'</ref> contains an announcement of the <persName xml:id="478">Abp. of York's</persName> resignation</hi>. This has been too long deferred.</p>
         <p>I travelled to Worcester by the 4.45 from Paddington, &amp; was met by <hi rend="underline">Frank Smith </hi>with the motor. We reached Kempsey about 8 p.m. The Vicar, <persName xml:id="1847">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Allen</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="1848">his wife</persName> were most sympathetic &amp; hospitable. The following morning (<hi rend="underline">Tuesday, Nov. 3</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi>) we first attended abbreviated Mattins in the parish Church: &amp; then went to <persName xml:id="1850" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Salt's</persName> house, where M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dennistoun's remains lay.  Thither came later the undertaker's men, &amp; when their melancholy duty had been performed, I brought my wife back for a farewell look, &amp; then hastened her away.  We caught the 2 p.m. express from Worcester, which reached Paddington about 4.15.  The exceptional beauty of the country on both sides of the line impressed us as we travelled.  The autumnal tints seen in the bright sunshine had a phantasmal appearance.</p>
         <p>The Church at Kempsey has one interesting monument, and one quaint inscription beginning; 'Hereunder ly the corruptible parts of a vicar.' There is a bust of the late <persName xml:id="1851">Sir Richard Temple</persName> under the Tower: &amp; a curious piscina in the Chancel. The sedilia are also notable. There are curious land–tenures in the parish. The Hams–meadows are private for some months in the year, &amp; public for the rest.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[385]</hi>
         </p>
         <p><persName xml:id="556">Jim Dennistoun</persName> arrived from India on Thursday morning, &amp; was met by <persName xml:id="290">Charlie Parker</persName> with the tidings of his father's death.  He reached <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> about noon.  Later we went all of us to Scotland by the night train; and attended the Funeral in the cemetery at Helensburgh.  I left Ella at Artarman, and returned by the night express to Westminster, arriving in Dean's Yard about 8 a.m. on Saturday morning.  I baptized <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1852">Angus Christian Edward Malcolm</persName></hi> in S. Margaret's at 12.45. <persName xml:id="239">Princess Christian</persName> was one of the sponsors: as I passed to my place at the Font, she leaned over, and whispered to me 'I am so sorry for your wife' – which was a very kind thing to do.  I caught the 2.35 p.m. from Liverpool Street to Cambridge, where I gave an <listEvent><event xml:id="59">address</event></listEvent> to the members of the 'Guild of the Annunciation' at S. Michael's: &amp; <hi rend="bold underline">then went to Brook House, where I was staying with <persName xml:id="427">Inge</persName></hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>  At dinner there came the <persName xml:id="574"><persName xml:id="573">Burkitts</persName></persName>, the <persName xml:id="789" display="no"><persName xml:id="1861" display="no">Stewards</persName></persName>, <persName xml:id="1853" display="no">Prof. Reed</persName>, &amp; a lady, whose name escaped me.  The next day – Nov. 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, my Birthday – was brilliantly fine, but very cold. We went to King's Chapel for service in the forenoon, &amp; arriving early, walked in the 'Backs' enjoying the most beautiful prospect conceivable. The autumnal tints reflected in the still water, &amp; illumined by the brilliant sun, were filled with melancholy charm.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[386]</hi>
         </p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">There was a large congregation in S. Mary's at 2.15 p.m. Both Inge &amp; <persName xml:id="1862">Bonney</persName> assured me afterwards that the attendance of undergraduates was the largest at that service which they could recollect</hi>.  My text was taken from the sermon on the Mount, "Cast not that which is holy to the dogs &amp;c."  I <ref xml:id="599">preached</ref> for about 3/4 an hour, and was listened to with the closest attention.  <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1864">Balfour Wilson</persName></hi> ran up to me after the sermon to exchange greetings.  Burkitt carried me off to see his new house, which is admirably comfortable &amp; well–arranged.  There I met his <persName xml:id="1863">son</persName>, a lanky youth about 20 years old, who is said to be delicate in health.  Then Inge &amp; <persName xml:id="1209">his wife</persName> came with me to tea with Prof. Bonney.</p>
         <p>Thus my Birthday passed in circumstances which brought back vividly to mind the day, 12 years since, when my <persName xml:id="83">Father</persName> died while I was preaching to the University of Oxford. I am 45 years old, and have done nothing. May I have grace to spend the rest of my days more worthily! "Show Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my heart unto Thee."</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 9<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Nov:, I left Cambridge by the 8.53 express: &amp; reached Westminster just a few minutes late for the Chapter Meeting: having been much delayed in the City, where the Lord Mayor's Show was preparing, &amp; the crowds were gathering thickly.</p>
