         </p>
         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>A bitterly cold day. Just a dozen com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m., including the clergy.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Mattins was but small. It included the <persName xml:id="325">Bp. of Winchester</persName>, the <persName xml:id="1563">Lord Advocate</persName>, <persName xml:id="193">Lord S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aldwyn</persName>, <persName xml:id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="290">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Charles Parker</persName>.  The approach of the Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">try </hi>session is indicated by such. I preached on the "Fall of Man" &#8211; attempting to give a permanent value to the Hebrew myth.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached on <hi rend="underline">S. Paul's</hi> glorying in his weaknesses.  There was but a moderate congregation.</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, I attended the Reception at the Admiralty accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1323" display="no">Miss Baddeley</persName>.  It amused me to observe that my little <ref xml:id="251">letter</ref> in the Spectator had evidently been taken to heart.  <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="889">Birrell</persName> avoided me conspicuously, <persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName> was distinctly cold. I was twice reminded of my words. I told <persName xml:id="1647" display="no">Burns</persName> that I thought his course patriotic</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, I went to the 'Mikado' with <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1300" display="no">Merton</persName>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[428]</hi>
         </p>
         <p><orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> met on Wednesday the 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, and sate until Friday, the 19<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> February.  I moved a Gravamen with respect to the action of the <orgName xml:id="95">National Society</orgName> &amp; the <orgName xml:id="96">Church defence C<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi></orgName> in uniting with the <orgName xml:id="20">E.C.U.</orgName>, the <orgName xml:id="97">Ch. Schools Emergency League</orgName>, &amp; the <orgName xml:id="98" display="no">Parents' League</orgName> in a combined policy opposed to the <persName xml:id="128">Abp's</persName> Educational efforts.  <persName xml:id="212">Wace</persName> attempted to get the Gravamen rejected as 'improper': but here he failed as a reference to the assessors determined the point against him.  So I had on Friday morning to move that the Gravamen be adopted as an <hi rend="underline">articulus cleri</hi>.  There was an exciting debate.  Wace spoke with much feeling: &amp; of course carried the house with him.  I was defeated by 53 to 21.  However the Gravamen went up signed by me, and <hi rend="italic">14 others. The Abp. in reply made some observations in which he practically endorsed it.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Wednesday afternoon <persName xml:id="126">Pryke</persName> brought forward the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> of the reports from the <orgName xml:id="99">'Moral Witness C<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi>'</orgName>. <persName xml:id="1318">Cunningham</persName> moved, &amp; I seconded a hostile amendment. In the course of the debate I made a vigorous speech, criticising the Report. Finally we agreed to send back the wretched thing to the C<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi> responsible for it.  Here, however, the rules of the Houses were a difficulty: &amp; finally on Friday afternoon it was hustled thro' a thin House.</p>
         <p>On Friday evening we attended the <persName xml:id="784">Speaker's</persName> reception, &amp; on Saturday dined quietly with the <persName xml:id="66"><persName xml:id="937">Pembers</persName></persName>.</p>
