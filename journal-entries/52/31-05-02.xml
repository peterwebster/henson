         <p>["] Religion does not demand new affections, but only claims the direction of those you already have, those affections you daily feel: though unhappily confined to objects, not altogether unsuitable, but altogether unequal to them.  We only represent to you the higher the adequate objects of those very faculties &amp; affections.["] </p>
         <p>Bishop Butler, Sermon. xiii</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Sybil, Lady Eden</hi>, came to lunch.  She said that when <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sargent</hi> painted her, he relieved the tedium of the sitting by occasionally going to the piano, &amp; playing exquisitely.  He made two unsuccessful attempts to get her portrait, &amp; only succeeded on the third effort.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park in the afternoon, and on returning to the castle, wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Elliott</hi> telling her that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi> had returned to school, &amp; also what were my intentions with respect to him.  May this, my last venture in this sort, turnout well!</p>
