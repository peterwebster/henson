         <p>There was a sprinkling of snow on the ground when I was called at 7:30 a.m.; but it was fast vanishing under the falling rain. However, I would not allow myself to despair of the day: but experience decided against my optimism. The weather, after a few deceiving intervals of sunshine, settled in tempestuous rain.</p>
         <p>We picked up Fearne at Corby, and lunched at Carlton House.  Then we continued our journey to Auckland, breaking it for tea at Boroughbridge. We reached home shortly after 7:30 p.m. The distance was about 225 miles, and an average pace was 32 miles in the hour.</p>
         <p>Among my letters were these annoying communications.  1. A complaint from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Casey</hi> against that intolerable fanatick, Jardine, for preaching in a Wesleyan Chapel.  2. The announcement that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Howe</hi> is about to introduce incense into his Church.  3. The new Vicar of Christ Church, Sunderland, is already beginning to provide his congregation with "Catholick privileges".  What madness has invaded the clerical mind at this time and in this diocese!</p>
