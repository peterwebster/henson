         </p>
         <p>The weather became colder, so that I caused the fire in my study, which had been stopped as was supposed for the summer, to be again lighted, her concession to physical ease which reason could justify better than religion.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning on the sermon for the Oddfellows. In the afternoon, I walked round the Park, &amp; picked up the doctor.</p>
         <p>We gave a dinner party. Our guests were:&#8211;</p>
         <p>1. The Bishop of Gloucester and Miss Headlam</p>
         <p>2. Lord &amp; Lady Thurlow.</p>
         <p>3. Professor &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Burkitt.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">4. Car√∂e</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>5. A school&#8211;mistress from the High School.</p>
         <p>6. Archdeacon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Rawlinson</p>
         <p>7. Our four selves &#8211; 14 in all.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Headlam</hi> tells me that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi> looks &amp; walks like an old man, that he speaks slowly &amp; that his normal 'long&#8211;windedness' has been emphasized, but that his voice is strong, his understanding <hi rend="strikethrough">strong</hi> vigorous &amp; alert as ever, and his assertion of complete recovery confident.  The affairs of the Church of England do not seem to have suffered by the Primate's protracted absence!</p>
