<hi rend="bold">Thursday, March 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The frost last night was the severest we have yet had. During the day the sun, which has now gained some strength, melted the snow: but the frost returned at nightfall.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> &amp; I motored to Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street, and had tea with Canon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Jackson</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Robinson</hi>, <hi rend="italic">the Churchwarden of Winlaton, had come at my request to see me in order to give me some trustworthy information about the state of affairs in Winlaton. He is a schoolmaster, and was one of the choirboys, whom Bishop </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lightfoot</hi><hi rend="italic"> had to sing in the Chapel here. He expressed himself with intelligence &amp; good feeling; finally undertaking to see both the Vicar and the Curate, and to report to me the result. I greatly fear that there are the materials and the promise of a lamentable scandal in that parish.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We motored to Bearpark, where I confirmed 53 persons from the parishes of Bearpark, Ushaw Moor, and Waterhouses. The incumbents' – <hi rend="doubleunderline">Riding</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Welby</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Burgess</hi> – were present with their candidates. The Church was crowded, and the attention was close &amp; sustained. I was pleased with the apparent earnestness of the candidates. After the service we returned to Auckland. The roads were very slippery with ice.</p>
