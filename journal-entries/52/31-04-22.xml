         <p>An ordination candidate named Hewitt came to lunch.  He is now at Mirfield, and has a title from S. Ignatius, Sunderland. He was a small man with bright eyes behind his spectacles, and no back to his skull. He had been reared a sectary, &amp; originally designed for the Primitive Methodist Ministry; but became discontented with sectarianism by reading Newman's 'Apologia'.</p>
         <p>Ella accompanied me to Sedgefield, where I confirmed about 45 candidates in the parish church, from Sedgefield, Stillington, and Bishop Middleham.  The incumbents were present.  After service we went to the Rectory, and had supper with Lord Thurlow and his family.  All the four boys were present, and another boy, Crawford, who was going to visit the Wall with Rowaleyn. Francis, who has just returned from Paris, where he has been trying to learn French, sat beside me, &amp; talked with vivacity &amp; intelligence. He has evidently formed a mean opinion of the French, who he holds to be a decadent race. After supper, we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>The weather has been mild &amp; wet.</p>
