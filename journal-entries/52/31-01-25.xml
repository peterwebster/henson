         <p> A beautiful morning, and without wind.  As I was celebrating at Spennymoor, there was no celebration in the Chapel, but I rose at the usual time, &amp; prepared (or rather revised) my notes for the sermons which I would preach later in the day.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> went to New Shildon to celebrate there, since the incumbent is <hi rend="underline">hors de combat</hi>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> went with me to Spennymoor, where the Patronal Festival of the parish church was being observed.  Mattins was followed by a choral celebration.  I preached &amp; celebrated.  My text was Romans xii. 18. "<hi rend="underline">Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits</hi>."  There were more than 100 communicants, &amp; of these a fair proportion were men.  Certainly I took a favourable impression from the service.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi> began his (permitted) ministry at Binchester, a fact which the local newspapers were careful to announce.</p>
         <p>I motored to Swallwell, where I arrived some minutes after time by reason of a foolish blunder on Leng's part.  He took me to Winlaton for some strange inexplicable cause.  The Church is small &amp; squalid.  The congregation was worthy of it.  Petitjean<persName xml:id="5498"></persName> was serenely selfâ€“satisfied!</p>
