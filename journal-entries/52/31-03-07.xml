         <p>More snow during the night, &amp; intermittent blizzards during the following day. I wasted much time in clearing up my chaotic table, which had become almost too congested for work.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Esmond Drury</hi> came to lunch, and afterwards walked with me in the snow. He talked freely of his experiences in Kenya. He is a well&#8211;grown, good&#8211;looking youth of 20, who is clearly puzzled as to his career. Probably he has never had any very serious thoughts about religion, but has a healthy outlook on the world, conventional and Philistine.

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Langford Day</hi> came to see me, a poor little gesticulating parson of 59, full of many grievances, and embarrassed for lack of employment. I said that if he could find a clergyman to employ him, I would grant permission for 3 months, &amp; then reconsider his situation. But I doubt his discovering any incumbent who will make the venture! His experience in this diocese so far has not been fortunate. Neither S. Francis nor S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aidan's is a tolerably worked parish. But the incumbents – <hi rend="doubleunderline">Warner</hi> &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Salkeld</hi> – are helpless, futile men, who are equally idle and incompetent.</p>
