<hi rend="bold">Thursday, January 15</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930</hi>[sic] <hi rend="bold">1931</hi>.</p>
         <p>A warm and blustering day.</p>
         <p>I motored to Durham, and presided at a meeting of the <hi rend="underline">Board of Training and Maintenance</hi>, at which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> was present in succession to Maish.</p>
         <p>Then, I attended a meeting of the <hi rend="underline">Castle Preservation Committee. </hi>  We agreed to proceed with the new piece of work.  The bankruptcy of the contractor was (so we were assured) no more than a reconstruction of the business, and would in no respect affect the carrying out of our contract.  We adopted a flatterous resolution of thanks to the Harkness trust, which I had drafted beforehand, &amp; I undertook to write to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Durham</hi>, asking him to join the Committee.</p>
         <p>Then, I had some conference with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi> on Diocesan Business.</p>
         <p>Then <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> &amp; I motored to Sunderland, where I <hi rend="bold underline">instituted the new Vicar, Rev. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">John Vincent Haswell</hi>, in Christ Church, in succession to Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cullagh</hi>.  There was a fair congregation, &amp; a good muster of the local clergy.  I spoke on <hi rend="underline">Anglicanism</hi>, &amp; was listened to with wondering attention! After the service we returned to Auckland.</p>
