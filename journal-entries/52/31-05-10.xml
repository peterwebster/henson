         <p>A wet morning, and warm. What the farmers call a â€˜good growing day'.  I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.  We numbered 7 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> including Elland and his wife.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning in my study preparing notes for the afternoon's sermon.  It occurred to me that I might recall the traditional origin of the Rogation days in order to talk about earthquakes, &amp; their religious suggestions.  The historic earthquakes in London (1750) and Lisbon (1755) provide some illustrative material to relieve the toedium!</p>
         <p>In spite of the weather, there was a goodly gathering of Freemasons in the Chapel at 3 pm.  My address was well listened to, though, perhaps, the brethren secretly wondered why I chose the subject.  Lord Thurlow read the prayers, &amp; Burkitt read the lesson.  Peter Richardson was in the company, &amp; stayed for tea.  He borrowed the two Russian romances &#8211; "The Death of the Gods" and "The Forerunner".</p>
         <p>I wrote to the Archbishop of York, Peers, Xan Wynne&#8211;Willson, Nigel Cornwall, Lionel Trotman, and Cyril Clarke.</p>
