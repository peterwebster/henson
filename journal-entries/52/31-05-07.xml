<hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> repeating in my letter the assurance which I had already given to his mother that, though I hoped &amp; desired that he would in due course carry out his present purpose of ordination, yet, if he found himself conscientiously opposed to being ordained when the time for final decision arrived, I should not regard him as in anyway pledged, &amp; should hope to retain his friendship in whatever career he chose.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth Hodgson</hi> had the impudence to write to me asking whether he might read at the Castle, as he was going to Oxford for an examination at the end of June.  I sent him a curt refusal.  That amazing youth appears to be quite unconscious both of the magnitude of his failure, and of the enormity of his conduct.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Rawlinson</hi> with the Registrar lunched at the Castle.  He was holding his Archidiaconal Visitation.</p>
         <p>I went into Durham, &amp; discussed some matters of diocesan business with the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; then went to Belmont, &amp; instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Suthrien</hi> to that incumbency.  There was a considerable congregation, &amp; most of the city clergy were present.  The air was heavy and thunderous.</p>
