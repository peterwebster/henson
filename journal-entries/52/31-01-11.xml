         <p>A calm morning, &amp; not quite so cold. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.  We numbered but four communicants â€“ <hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi>, two maids, &amp; myself.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> was celebrating at New Shildon, where the Vicar is sick: Ella has not yet returned to normal health: <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fearne</hi> overslept herself: &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Alexander</hi>'s sciatica was prohibitive of kneeling.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> and I motored to Stockton, where I unveiled a window to the memory of the late incumbent, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Vincent Harlow</hi>, and afterwards lunched with the present Vicar, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Champion</hi>. Save that he went his own lawless way after the third collect, concerning which I spoke to him afterwards, the Vicar pleased me. I noted a great improvement in the choir which consisted of 12 men &amp; 19 boys. There was a considerable congregation, which included a fair proportion of young men. Evidently he is making headway with the people. After lunch, I returned to Auckland.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Robinson</hi> went to Durham in the morning, and returned to lunch, properly impressed by the cathedral.  I set him down to study the account of the finds in the grave of S. Cuthbert, which is given in the volume of the Victoria History, which deals with Durham.</p>
