         <p>I received a pleasant letter from Christine which gave me genuine pleasure.</p>
         <p>Greatly to my disappointment Ella kept her room, pleading "a slight chill".</p>
         <p>Two representatives of "Toc H." lunched here, and discussed with me a rather vapourous project which they had framed under the inspiration of a grant (&#x00A3;5000) from the "Pilgrim Trust". It includes the establishment in the diocese of Durham of 3 centres, and of these one was to be in Bishop Auckland. They wondered whether they could have the Lightfoot Institute as their "local habitation". I wrote a note of introduction to the Vicar, and despatched them with the vaguest of non&#8211;committal benedictions. Their project seems to me to lack every <hi rend="underline">known</hi> element of permanent success.</p>
         <p>The Education Bill was supported in the Lords by the Abp. of York &amp; the Bps of Liverpool, S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Alban's, and Southwark. It was opposed by the Bishops of Norwich &amp; S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Edmundsbury &amp; Ipswich. This hardly discloses a very impressive amount of episcopal zeal. The normal Conservatism of most of the Bishops was enough to cause their absenteeism: &amp; nobody thinks the Bill worth much. </p>
