<hi rend="bold underline">Today the Times reports the Fall of Alphonso, and the establishment of a Republic in Spain</hi>.  Quo tendimus? There is something repugnant in the spectacle of a Throne falling without any attempt to defend it: but the days of Chivalry are past beyond recall. Nobody suspects the King of lack of courage.</p>
         <p>There came to lunch M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Findlay and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lullington.  We had a brisk discussion about theology, &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Findlay expressed himself (as it seemed to me) with crudity &amp; lack both of sympathy with Christianity &amp; knowledge of it.  He informed me that he was a "Spiritualist", &amp; followed Sir Oliver Lodge.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Burkitt took us to have tea with Colonel and Lady Mary Griffin at Bourne Hall, a fascinating Elizabethan house full of antiquarian treasures.  The mantel piece in the drawing room was dated 1555, but the water&#8211;spouts were dated 1602.</p>
         <p>There came to dine M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Law (n&amp;#x00E9;e Beresford Hope).  We talked pleasantly &amp; continuously .. but left nothing to be recorded!</p>
