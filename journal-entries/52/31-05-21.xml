<hi rend="bold">Thursday, May 21</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>There was a sharp frost last night.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Burkitt</hi> and his wife left after breakfast.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I went into Durham and attended a little function at the hideous scientific laboratory, where our new Chancellor opened an additional building. He made quite a good speech. I also made a speech in moving a vote of thanks. Everybody was very pleasant &amp; kindly, &amp;, of course, in the democratic fashion, enormously well pleased with themselves! On returning to Auckland, I <hi rend="bold underline">sent to the Dean of Durham my official decision on the question of residence</hi>, which the Dean &amp; Chapter had referred to me as Visitor of the College.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> and I motored to Brandon where I confirmed 26 candidates from a parish of 16,000 people: and where there have been not less than three clergymen resident, and presumably working!  The miserable bickerings between the Vicar and his curates following upon the dreadful scandal of three years ago have as nearly "killed" the church in Brandon as possible.  It is not easy to see how there can be any improvement while the present personnel remain.</p>
