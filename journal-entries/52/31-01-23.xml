         <p>Another beautiful day, but tending to be boisterous.  I worked at a sermon for the Temple, but with little success: &amp; in the afternoon, I walked round the Park with the dogs.</p>
         <p>Alfred Toomey came to see me.  He is evidently unequal to the strenuous &amp; mechanical life ordained for a curate in this parish under the soulless automaton, who now holds the cure of souls.  But what can be done?</p>
         <p>The '<hi rend="underline">Church Times</hi>" emphasizes what it calls the 'débacle' of the Bishop of Liverpool, in his controversy with the Popish Archbishop.  I doubt not that the substance of his indictment is just: but I suspect that he is quite unable to produce evidence for his statements.  He is far too impulsive, credulous, &amp; unreflecting for the task of controversy with so experienced &amp; unscrupulous an adversary.</p>
         <p>I finished <hi rend="doubleunderline">Winston Churchill</hi>'s fascinating book, "<hi rend="underline">My Early life</hi>". It is extremely well–written, and quite extraordinarily interesting.</p>
         <p>Also, on the Bishop of Jarrow's recommendation, I began to read a rather heavy volume of Essays, entitled "The Evangelical Doctrine of Holy Communion".</p>
