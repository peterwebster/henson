         <p>I finished the little book, <hi rend="underline">Mahatma Gandhi, the man who became one with the Universal Being</hi> by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Romain Rolland</hi>. It is charmingly written, &amp; assists one to realise the impossibility of maintaining the status quo in India. The situation contradicts all precedents so dramatically that statesmanship in front of it is completely non&#8211;plussed. Only a miracle can solve the Indian problem, &amp; it may be that Ghandi will provide it.</p>
         <p>An Ordination candidate, <hi rend="doubleunderline">William John Kerby</hi>, came to be interviewed, &amp; to stay the night. He comes from an ultra&#8211; Anglo Catholic seminary â€“ Chichester &#8211; but he disclaims Anglo Catholicism. I suspect that there is revolt against that fanaticism in many of their nominal disciples. But even so, revolt however well justified, is not the most desirable temper for an Ordination candidate.</p>
