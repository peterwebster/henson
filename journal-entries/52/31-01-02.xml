<hi rend="bold">Friday, January 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A beautiful day, bright, still, &amp; frosty.  I finished the Article, "The Church &amp; the Modern State."</p>
         <p>Lady Londonderry lunched here bringing M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Munro Ferguson, &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Lindemann, Professor of Experimental Philosophy, Oxford. After lunch, I showed them the Chapel &amp; the State&#8211;room. Lady L. greatly approved the blue hangings in the Chapel. After they had departed I walked in the Park with D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Cullagh.  There are said to be no fewer than 180 pit ponies in the Park, a sure sign of idleness in the mines.</p>
         <p>Prof: Lindemann told me that the Russian Professor who was his "opposite number " in the University of Moscow had no less than &#x00A3;500,000 placed at his disposal for the purposes of his chair. As their abominable atheistic and immoral obsessions did not enter into their treatment of science, the Bolshevists left him free to pursue his researches.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">Lady L. told me that she had just received a letter from the King of Spain assuring her that the "Revolution" had been a very trivial affair, &amp; was completely suppressed.</hi>  But monarchs are rarely well informed about the movements which dethrone them!</p>
