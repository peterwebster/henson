         <p>That garrulous and conceited fellow, P.Y. Knight, sends me a cutting from the <hi rend="underline">Guardian</hi>, in which he "lets himself go" on the shortage of clergy in the Diocese of Durham.<hi rend="italic">  He has the impudence to set out the various attractions of that diocese, reviewing the qualities of the leading clergy! </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Thus of his own diocesan:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">"We have a Bishop, indefatigable in energy, of great ability, who always gives of his best in sermons &amp; addresses, &amp; although one may not agree with him, yet he always gives a fair hearing to views different from his own. He loves young men, &amp; likes to have them about him at Auckland."</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">This is not much to say for the successor of S. Cuthbert, but it is probably all that most would be willing to say, and a good deal more than any could truthfully say. I fear that as a Bishop I must be reckoned a failure. Apart from more apparent faults, of which there are many, I am not sufficiently in sympathy with current movements, and I am not sufficiently interested in ecclesiastical questions</hi>.</p>

         <p>Then I walked for an hour in the garden &amp; 'policies'. I wrote a note to the Vicar sending him a copy of the 'Bishoprick', in order that he might read what I have written about the Lambeth Conference.</p>
         <p>After lunch Blanche motored us to Southwell where we visited the Cathedral. The librarian (?) Mr. James, an intelligent &amp; well&#8211;informed man, acted as our guide: &amp; in the marvellous chapter&#8211;house, which is the unique distinction of the church, we had the benefit of the verger's enthusiasm &amp; knowledge. Certainly, the carvings in the Chapter house might well stir enthusiasm. I know nothing more delicately &amp; discerningly beautiful. After seeing the Cathedral, we had tea in an old inn &#8211; "the Saracen's Head". Here Charles I. is said to have slept. We were shown His Majesty's bed room.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I finished reading a substantial volume which has just issued from the Cambridge Press :&#8211; "The Cardinal of Lorraine and the Council of Trent A Study in the Counter&#8211;Reformation, by H.Â Outram Evennett, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge." The account of the Colloquy of Poissy has a curious resemblance to the story of many modern conferences on the eternal conundrum of "Reunion".</hi>
