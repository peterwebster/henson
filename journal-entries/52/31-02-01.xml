<hi rend="bold">Septuagesima, February 1</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We were only 4 communicants â€“ M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Berry, one of the maids, William &amp; myself.  Charles was celebrating at New Shildon.  Ella &amp; Fearne were away from home.</p>
         <p>The Epistle for this Sunday is short, stern, minatory, like a military command on a day of battle. What do the Calvinists make of S. Paul's fear lest "<hi rend="underline">When he had preached to others he himself should be a castaway'</hi>? </p>
         <p>I went through the Temple sermon yet once again, trying to give it a more connected form, &amp; to emphasize the dissent from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ralph's</hi> fierce "<hi rend="underline">Protestantism</hi>", while removing the direct reference to him. A quotation from his saner predecessor, Church, perhaps made such a reference superfluous. But now I am in some doubt about the length of the sermon, which will, I judge, take about half an hour to deliver.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The Papers report the death of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Robertson</hi><hi rend="bold underline">, once Bishop of Exeter</hi>, but for nearly 15 years an invalid living in retirement in Oxford. For 14 years (1883&#8211;97) he was Principal of Hatfield Hall, Durham: and he was the successful candidate for the Bampton Lectureship when I was the unsuccessful one in 1901. How differently might my life have worked out, had I been appointed!</p>

<hi rend="italic">I read through the Pope's Encyclical on 'Christian marriage" which has been published as a pamphlet by the 'Catholic Truth Society'.  The full title indicates its range &amp; character:  "</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">On Christian Marriage in view of the present conditions needs errors and vices that affect the family &amp; society</hi><hi rend="italic">". It extends to 67 pages, and reads fairly well.  The oracular style of unquestioned &amp; unquestionable authority is not without an impressiveness of its own, but all the conditions of the "Sex&#8211;problem", as it confronts an informed &amp; considering Christian today are simply ignored.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Observer</hi><hi rend="italic">" reports that the jury returned a verdict </hi>of "Guilty" against Rouse, in whose burnt car the body of an unknown man was found.  The Judge, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Talbot</hi>, passed sentence of death.  In this case the entire evidence was 'circumstantial', and no 'motive' was suggested.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Robin, William, Ella, Gilbert, Archdeacon Cornwall, Canon Stack, Frank Bishop, Charles and I went to the Chapel and read our Evensong together.  Tonight I complete thirteen years of my episcopate. It began in resentments and apprehensions: it has moved through much confusion and disappointment: to what manner of ending is it destined?</p>
