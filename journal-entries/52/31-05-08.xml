         <p>My attempt to "cry off" my engagement to speak for the Lifeboat Society in Westminster next Wednesday has failed, for <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Godfrey Baring</hi> the Chairman wrote me so disarming a letter that I could not but "Keep Tryst", but it is none the less a sad waste of time, energy &amp; money.</p>
         <p>I worked at the "Ruling on Residence for Canons, and made some kind of an end. I sent the draft to my Chancellor for his endorsement.</p>
         <p>The Warden of Keble sent me the paper to be filled up for <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek's</hi> admission if he passes the College examination in July.  It would be rather daunting if he failed!  I sent the paper to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Budworth</hi>, to be filled up, and sent on.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Welch</hi> who is back from Southern Nigeria came to dine and sleep.  He is rather thin, and very silent, the result of silence in the tropics.  He gives me the impression of disillusionment, perhaps of regret: and I doubt whether he will return to Africa.  He evidently thinks that the Roman Catholicks are gaining ground in the African Mission field.  Their methods are sounder, &amp; their resources greater than ours.</p>
