         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8:00 a.m.: we numbered 8 communicants, including <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Murray</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi>.</p>
         <p>After lunch I filled up the Census paper. The number was increased by the two visitors.</p>
         <p>The weather which had been threatening all the morning became definitely wet in the afternoon.  Nonetheless, I walked with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi> in the Park, and had a "heart&#8211;to&#8211;heart" talk with him about his future.  He accompanied Charles and me when we motored to Jarrow for Evensong.  The weather was villainous, and it affected the congregation.  But the church was three parts filled : there was a large choir which sang unusually well : and both <hi rend="doubleunderline">Booth</hi> and his curate <hi rend="doubleunderline">Latimer</hi> did their duty very efficiently.  I preached from Exodus xii.26.  "<hi rend="underline">What mean ye by this Service?</hi>" and spoke "large" on the subject of the Festival.  The congregation seemed to be interested.  After the service we looked at the Church, &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi> sate in Bede's chair.  We got home about 9:45 p.m.  The rain had ceased, but the land was covered with a melancholy and minatory mist.</p>
