<hi rend="bold">Monday, February 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A most beautiful day, beginning with frost but becoming almost springlike. There is a mighty pother among the rooks, and there is a sound of singing at day&#8211;break. I occupied the morning in the futile task of preparing an answer to the Dean's questions. In the afternoon I walked for an hour in the park with <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">McCullagh</hi>.</p>
         <p>An Ordination candidate named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Suthraen</hi> came to tea. He sought and obtained my permission to his offering a tithe from Stranton. He was not a very prepossessing youth to look at, but he seemed both sincere &amp; ardent. He hopes to spend his life, after 3 years in Durham, as a missionary to Moslems.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Basil M</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Crorie</hi><hi rend="italic"> writes again repeating his appeal for assistance, &amp; putting me to the hateful necessity of again rejecting it.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Paine</hi>, who is to have charge of the work of pulling down the stables &amp;c, appeared on the scene. I gave him permission to use the rooms in the Gatehouse, if he could arrive at an arrangement with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ashton</hi>. I am not sanguine as the fulfilment of this condition.</p>
