         <p>The weather was detestable, unhealthily warm, wet, and finally tempestuous.  <hi rend="bold underline">I preached twice in the Cathedral</hi>, and on both occasions the weather affected the congregation unfavourably.  However, there were many people in the cathedral, and they were creditably attentive.  In the morning I found the voice&#8211;magnifying machinery rather embarrassing: but, in the evening the annoyance was less.  The Student Christian Association has an annual service in the cathedral.  They turned out in considerable numbers.  <hi rend="bold underline">My sermon included a criticism of the Dean of S. Paul's</hi>, and this circumstance may have added to the interest of the sermon, which was, I fear, very dull.  Two students, a male and a female, read the lessons.  They were introduced to me afterwards, and I complimented the young lady on the excellence of her reading.  I did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> add that I thought it little less than scandalous that she should read at all in such a place!</p>
         <p>The ceremonial in the cathedral is almost oppressively precise, and regulated.</p>
