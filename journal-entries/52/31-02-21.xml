         <p>A most beautiful day. Brilliant sun. I spent the whole morning in writing to the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Manchester</hi>, who wrote to ask for materials wherewith he might construct a reply to that persistent hair&#8211;splitter, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bennett</hi>, who has "discovered" that the Test Act did not exclude Protestant Dissenters from sitting in Parliament. He is, of course, right, but nothing turns on the point. But what waste of good time this is!</p>
         <p>The Vice&#8211;Chancellor writes to ask me to preach the Commemoration Sermon at Oxford on June 21<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>. But that is the day on which I am pledged to preach in the Abbey. Possibly the two engagements might be harmonized by my getting up to London from Oxford on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> &amp; I motored to Crook where I consecrated a portion of the new Cemetery. It was bitterly cold, but a large number of people had gathered, &amp; accompanied the procession round the ground. After the service, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ridley Barker</hi>, took me to the Church, &amp; showed me the new marble pavement with which it is being adorned; &amp; which, of course, he wants me to "dedicate". As faith declines, these benedictions of every variety of material object tend ever to multiply!</p>
