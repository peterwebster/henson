<hi rend="bold">Monday, March 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1931.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The morning post brought the news of the death of the Vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Barnabas, Hendon (<hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> E.B. Rhodes</hi>). He has been but two years in the parish, &amp; hardly 8 years in Holy Orders. The poor man had but lately married. His wife gave birth to her first child almost as its father expired. He had made a good start in his parish.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Heaver</hi>, offering him appointment to Pallion. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Spencer Wade</hi> wrote to tell me that he had accepted the living of Wark&#8211;on&#8211;Tyne. </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> and I motored to Barnard Castle School, where I confirmed 27 boys in the School Chapel. We proceeded to Staindrop, where we had tea with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Spurrier</hi>, and afterwards went to Church for the Confirmation. I confirmed 73 persons. The service was pleasing save for the clamourous &amp; persistent coughing of the congregation: the candidates were still and attentive.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The keeper at Raby told </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Spurrier</hi><hi rend="italic"> that many small birds were picked up dead in the woods during the last fortnight. I fear that both birds and plants will have suffered severely. Nor is it certain that </hi>we are yet done with this interminable winter.</p>
