         </p>
         <p>A bitter and boisterous day, with a blizzard blowing hard, &amp; roads perilous. There was some snow.</p>
         <p>I finished the Temple sermon which is quite other than I had intended.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Suthrien</hi><persName xml:id="5364"></persName> came to lunch.  He told me that he is meditating matrimony: &amp; hopes to be allowed to remain at Ingleton until Easter.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Shaddick</hi> came to tea.  He is full of his experiences at the "Way of Renewal" Conference at High Lea, to which he and Sturt went as representatives of this diocese.  I was interested to learn that, though he enjoyed his visit, he was not greatly impressed.  There was a vast quantity of talk, but extremely little practical suggestion.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi>, addressing my letter to 'The Riviera Hotel, Canford Cliffs, Bournemouth'.  Also I sent her a copy of the 'Bishoprick' which with commendable punctuality was issued today.</p>
         <p>Then by a prodigious effort I cleared up the confused mass of papers which had accumulated on my Table.</p>
