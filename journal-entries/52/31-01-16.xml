         <p>Charles accompanied me to Darlington where I took train for Warwick.  I travelled from York to Birmingham in the company of a schoolboy named <hi rend="italic">Hedley, who was going back to school at Clifton from his home at Middlesborough.[sic]  The car met me at the station in Warwick, &amp; carried me to the Castle.  I found </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Anthony Eden</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; his wife staying there.  </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lady Warwick </hi><hi rend="italic">is Mayor of the City.  Her son, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Fulke</hi><hi rend="italic">, the young Earl, and her daughter made up the party.  After dinner his Lordship showed me the State rooms, which are magnificent.  I had not expected to see such a wealth of pictures, furniture, armour etc.: but the family was in the past very wealthy: it was generally on the winning side at crises of political trouble; and its accumulated treasures have never been dispersed.  The portraits by </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Vandyck</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Holbein</hi><hi rend="italic"> are wonderful: &amp; the furniture which came from Kenilworth most sumptuous.  I have never seen such elaborate carved beds and panelling elsewhere.</hi>
