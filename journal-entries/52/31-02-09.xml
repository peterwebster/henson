         <p>I left the Master's House after breakfast, and, after visiting the hair dresser and the bookseller, proceeded to King's Cross, where I took the Pullman Express to Darlington, where Charles met me with the car. After tea, we went through the accumulated correspondence. It included a very long &amp; very interesting letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Welch</hi> in Nigeria. He expresses himself with intelligence, vigour, and independence. It is difficult to believe that he will be long content to wear the uniform of the C.M.S. His personal interest is rather ethnological than evangelistic. <hi rend="italic">There were several letters expressed with some vehemence protesting against my speech on Russia. The writers suggest that the situation in England is worse than that in Russia. Could the blindness of partisanship be more grossly apparent?</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Before going to bed I wrote cheques for a number of bills that had come in during my absence. The new curtains placed in the Chapel have cost me &#x00A3;37:5:0. They will serve to mark the completion of ten years of my episcopate.</p>
         <p>The weather degenerated as the night advanced, &amp; when I went to bed, rain was falling heavily.</p>
