         <p>Charles went with me to Darlington, where I took the early train to London. On arriving at Kings Cross, I drove to the Athenaeum, &amp; then went to the hairdresser, &amp; having been capitally civilized proceeded to the Wesleyan Central Hall at Westminster for the meeting of the Royal Lifeboat Institution. The hall was not quite filled, a fact which surprised me as the Prince of Wales was in the Chair. H.R.H. looks bronzed and fit, but he still fidgets ceaseless with hands &amp; feet. He seemed to be in an ill temper &amp; read his speech badly, like a schoolboy doing an exercise<hi rend="bold">.  </hi><hi rend="bold underline">My speech was a complete failure. It never got hold of the audience at all, &amp; though prepared with some care, was quite unsuitable for the occasion.</hi>  I went to the club, and got tea.  Then I made my way to Kings Cross, &amp; returned to Durham.  My compagnon de voyage was M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> White of Newcastle, by conversing with whom I relieved the toedium of the journey.</p>
         <p>At Darlington I met Ella &amp; Fearne, who had returned from Scotland, and we all came back to the Castle together in the car.</p>
