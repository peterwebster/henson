         <p>I packed my bag and joined mine host. We travelled to Euston by the early train, on which we had breakfast. Whether my exertions yesterday were the cause, I cannot say, but I slept most of the journey.  On arriving in London, I drove at once to the Athenaeum, where a bedroom had been reserved for me.  Then I lunched, having some conversation with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Athelstan Riley</hi>, whose deafness increases.  After visiting the hairdresser, I drove to Lambeth, and attended <hi rend="bold underline">the meeting of Bishops</hi>.  The Archbishop of York presided, and began by giving us a message from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi>, who expressed his grief and shame at finding himself again unable to preside over the Bishops.  <hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Dawson</hi><hi rend="italic"> was reported to have said that the root of the Archbishop's illness was his assumption that in your sixties you can do what you did in your forties. That is a warning which is relevant to more cases than the case of the Archbishop. I dined at the Athenaeum, and then wrote up my journal, &amp; a "Collins" to Lady Warwick.</hi>
