         </p>
         <p>I went to the hair&#8211;dresser for a final shampoo, &amp; paid a visit to the book seller, where I bought <hi rend="doubleunderline">Winston Churchill</hi>'s latest book, "<hi rend="doubleunderline">My early life</hi>", as provender for the journey, &amp; then 'took up my carriages', and returned to Auckland by the Pullman express, which brought me to Darlington at 4.7 p.m.  There I was met by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi>, &amp; so came to the Castle, where I found <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi> downstairs, &amp; looking much better. </p>
         <p>I wrote civilly to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Shebbeare</hi>, acknowledging the "magnanimity" of his reception of my "rebuke", and postponing the casuistic discussion to a more convenient season.</p>
         <p>I sent a cheque for <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi>'s fees to the Headmaster, and wrote to his mother in reply to a letter from her. Term begins tomorrow.</p>
         <p>The bishop of Carlisle told me yesterday that Professor <hi rend="doubleunderline">Taylor</hi> of S. Andrew's, who has become our leading Anglican philosopher, since <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rashdall</hi>'s death, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Inge</hi>'s decline into journalism, has been received into the Roman Church.  If this be so, the Papists will have made a considerable capture.</p>
