         </p>
         <p>We 'took up our carriages', and made our journey to Cambridge, stopping at Corby to lunch with Brooke and Fosca, and having tea at "The Old Bridge Hotel in Huntingdon.</p>
         <p>The weather, which was uncertain when we started, improved as the day advanced, and the final stage of the route was brilliant.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Burkitt received us with kindness, and disclosed amply those conversational powers, which made her the wonder of acquaintances and the terror of friends!  There came to dine M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Scott, lately returned from Japan.  He asked me whether I knew <hi rend="doubleunderline">Alfred Spelling</hi>, and said that he was at school with him at Chigwell.</p>
         <p>Brooke showed us the parish church of Corby. It is a fair specimen of a medieval parish church, not on the largest scale. The 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century font was rather unusual: and the chancel was distinguished by an elaborate "Easter Sepulchre", or, possibly, the frame of a tomb.</p>
