<hi rend="doubleunderline">Mary Radford</hi><hi> and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Reggie Smith</hi><hi> went away after breakfast.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi><hi>, the Vicar of Pelton, came to </hi><hi rend="italic">see me and I took occasion to rate him soundly for his folly. He is a very foolish, ignorant fellow and enormously conceited. I doubt whether he is capable of taking reproof: &amp; it may be that he has some kind of a mental kink.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Jessie Hedger</hi><hi>, now </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Lemon</hi><hi>, writes to me from Australia. It is more than 30 years since I have seen her, &amp; then she had been "converted" to Papistry in Ilford, and I "recovered" her. She was then a pretty, rather unsteady girl, after whom the boys ran, &amp; who simply couldn't help "making eyes" at them. But there was no harm in her, only high spirits and flightiness. She wants me to send her a photograph! It is truly amzing that the humbler English cling to their attachments, personal &amp; local, with a tenacity which nothing can break.</hi>
