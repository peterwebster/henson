<hi rend="italic">We disposed of the Report of the Committee on the Ministry, and made a beginning on that on Moral Witness.  The morning was filled by the debate on Deaconesses, in the course of which </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I made a speech which was loudly applauded, &amp; seemed to impress the Conference.</hi><hi rend="italic">  A number of the Bishops thanked me for it, and expressed admiration.  In this, I think they were mistaken, for the speech was really a flimsy, poor, impromptu affair, which owed all its effectiveness to the speaker's sincerity, and the essential soundness of his argument.  </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The vote, of course, went against me</hi><hi>. </hi><hi rend="italic">But there was a substantial minority, and I asked that the numbers might be recorded: but the Archbishop was reluctant, &amp; I yielded to his wishes.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">Rather to my surprize there was a considerable discussion, which stood over for the morrow.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">The garden party given by the Archbishops and Bishops of England took place in the Palace grounds. Save for the occasional showers, everything seemed to go off happily. We are collecting visitors for August: viz. Archbishop and M</hi><hi rend="i superscript">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> Cantes, the Bishop of Rhode Island &amp; his wife, and the Bishop of Blackburn and M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> Herbert.

<hi>We returned to Neville Terrace by bus and underground, an unexpectedly easy journey. Ella went out to dine with her friend, the vegetarian crank&#8211;lady, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Webb, the cricketer's wife.</hi>
