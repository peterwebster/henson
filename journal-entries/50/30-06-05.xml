<hi rend="italic">Dr Adam Philip of the Manse, Invergowrie, sends me two books which he has written viz: the Pedigree of Archbishop Davidson, published in 1903, when he became Archbishop: and 'The Devotional Literature of Scotland'. </hi><hi rend="i bold">I did not realize that Davidson came of ancestry mainly composed of Presbyterian ministers. Evidently his fellow&#8211;countrymen were much exalted by his gaining the Primacy, which they now regard as a peculium of the Presbytery.</hi>
