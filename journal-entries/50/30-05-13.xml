<hi>Llewelyn, the assistant curate of Shildon came to lunch with his wife. They desired to say Goodbye, before leaving the diocese to a benefice in the diocese of Leicester, Donnington. He is not a brilliant person, nor indeed anywise distinguished, but he has worked well, and been acceptable to the people. So I regret his departure.</hi>
