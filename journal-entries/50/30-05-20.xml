<hi>Lieutenant </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">McLeod</hi><hi> went off after breakfast, and I spent almost the whole morning in writing letters.  Among these was one to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Graham White</hi><hi> in reply to a letter expressing great perturbation at </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Major</hi><hi>'s recent pronouncements.  I shall be much surprized if his distress is not widely distributed among religious folk.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> and I walked round the Park, and later motored to Trimdon Grange, where I confirmed about sixty persons in the mean little church.  The atmosphere was asphyxiating, for the building was densely crowded, and the evening was damp and sultry.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Gow</hi><hi>, who had been staying at the Deanery, arrived for a visit. She grows older, &amp; and is, perhaps, somewhat less terrifying than of old, but she remains formidable!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I wrote shortly to old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Wilson</hi><hi>, thanking him for his letter, which I did not attempt to answer or discuss.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Five cases of stuffed birds arrived from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir William Gray</hi><hi>, and were placed in the vestibule leading to the Chapel.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">George Dennistoun</hi><hi> arrived on a visit.</hi>
