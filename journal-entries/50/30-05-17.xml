<hi>I receive a letter from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rawlinson</hi><hi> which tells me that this woeful business in W. Hartlepool has been nosed out by the reporters, &amp; that there is much evil local gossip.  Also, I received a letter from M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> G. which I answered. I revised the sermon for York.</hi>

The general conclusion is that Oxford is not the place for Ordination candidates. </hi>
