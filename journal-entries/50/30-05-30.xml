<hi rend="bold">Friday, May 30</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930, G.D.A.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The glorious weather continues.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Gow</hi><hi> left after breakfast: and I settled down to a futile morning of correspondence &amp; promiscuous reading.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I wrote a rather belated letter to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi><hi> had a number of visitors in the afternoon, including a Colonel &amp; Mrs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Noble</hi><hi>, whom </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lillingstone</hi><hi> brought with him from Durham.  I showed them the Chapel.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The members of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fearne</hi><hi>'s society, the G.D.A, only numbered 8.  Archdeacon </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rawlinson</hi><hi> &amp; his wife came also.  I do not quite understand the purpose of the society, but gather that it is a socially select (!) version of the G.F.S.  How any living religion can be expected to grow from the root of snobbery is hard to see, but we must "</hi><hi rend="underline">fulfil all righteousness</hi><hi>".</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The weather deteriorated as the afternoon drew towards evening, and anxiety as to the weather on Monday began to shadow my mind. Rawlinson &amp; his wife arrived. He is quite at home with these devotional experiments. I attend compline, but did not stay for the address as I don't want him to get the impression that I am doubtful as to his teaching!</hi>
