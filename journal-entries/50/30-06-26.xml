<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> and I went into Durham, &amp; attended the Convocation, which met in the Chapter House.  A large number of degrees were conferred, including a D.D. for the Bishop of Jarrow.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dawson–Walker</hi><hi> introduced him at some length, &amp; very flatterously.  Among those who took their M.A. degree was </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jack Carr</hi><hi>.  [symbol] After this function, there followed a special service in the Cathedral, which, rather to my surprize, was very well attended.  </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I preached a short sermon</hi><hi>: &amp; then interviewed an Ordination candidate </hi><hi rend="italic">in the Chapter House.

<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Heywood</hi><hi rend="italic">. Here I had some talk with a Russian, Baron von </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Mayernsdorff</hi><hi rend="italic">, who was Vice–President of the Russian Duma in 1907, &amp; is now an exile.  He was not very informing, &amp;, though I asked him many questions, and received many answers, I learned nothing.  </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">He did however assure me that Douillet, the author of Moscow Unmasked was a trustworthy writer.</hi>
