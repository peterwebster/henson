         <p>
<hi>I applied for membership of the </hi><hi rend="underline">Research Defence Society</hi><hi>, and authorized my Bankers to pay the annual subscription of ten shillings. Then I frittered away the morning in putting together materials for my address to the medical students.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I walked round the Park: being much incommoded by the heat and the flies.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi><hi> motored to Durham, and met the train from Scotland in which the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Rhode Island</hi><hi> and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Perry</hi><hi> were travelling.  She took them to the Deanery, where they had tea, &amp; were then shown over the Cathedral.  Then they came on to Auckland, &amp; arrived there in good time for dinner.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> McCullagh</hi><hi> came to dine.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>We had much pleasant and interesting conversation. The Bishop said that the resolution about the marriage would be more noticed in America than the resolution on "Birth&#8211;control". The first subject was of pressing importance, but not the last. He agreed, however, that "Birth&#8211;control" was beginning to be much discussed since the publication of Judge Lindsay's Books.</hi>
