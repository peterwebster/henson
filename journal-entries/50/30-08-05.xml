<hi>I took my departure from 12 Neville Terrace after an occupation of 5 weeks. Ella and Fearne left by the 1.40 p.m. train, but I postponed my exit until the 5.30 p.m. in order that I might see and Ordination candidate in the club at 4 p.m.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I spent the morning at Lambeth where the Resolutions on 'Youth' were under discussion. The subject was 'impossible': and the Report necessarily windy &amp; platitudinous. Neville Talbot moved an addition to the official Resolution, in which he spoke of 'great &amp; romantic' work. I asked what he meant by "romantic": &amp; he told me that if I had lived in S. Africa, &amp; endeavoured to secure just treatment of the blacks by the whites I would know! None the less the Conference rejected it, and also the word 'heroic'.</hi>

<hi>I lunched at the United Service Club, where </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Macmillan</hi><hi> joined me, &amp; was very friendly.  I went early to King's Cross, expecting that there would have been a holiday rush to the north, but there was no unusual number of travellers, and, in point of fact, I had a department to myself.</hi>
