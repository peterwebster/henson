<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Harnack</hi><hi rend="italic">'s death is reported in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">, which gives a long obituary notice.  The War went far to eclipse him, and the rise of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Loisy</hi><hi rend="italic"> with his union of destructive criticism and extreme ecclesiasticism divided his empire, but one time he wielded great authority in England.  His '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">History of Dogma</hi><hi rend="italic">' has not yet been replaced.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Graham White</hi><hi> departed after lunch, leaving on me an impression which was by no means wholly favourable.  He is plainly discontented with his position, &amp; disposed to belittle, perhaps to calumniate, his superiors and colleagues.  The account of the Church in the Malay peninsula which he gave was distinctly unpleasing.  Mainly I think he was "sniffing after" Sedgefield.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> and I motored to Sunderland, where we had an early dinner with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wynneâ€“Willson</hi><hi>, and then attended the men's missionary meeting.
