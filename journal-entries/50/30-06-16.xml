<hi>Pattinson went with me to Darlington where I took train to King's Cross.  I had the Bishop of Jarrow as my travelling companion.  The Archbishop of York came into the carriage, and I asked him whether any progress had been made in appointing the Church and State Commission.  He replied that the Chairman had been appointed, &amp; the choice of the other members of the Commission had been postponed on account of Lang's illness.  On arriving in London I drove to [symbol] </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Park Lane</hi><hi>, &amp; left my bags.  Then I went to the hair–dresser, &amp; was shampooed.

It dealt with three subjects – Kenia [sic], the African fauna, and unemployment – and on all he was keen, suggestive, and informing. He deprecated any action adverse to the colonists in Kenia [sic], but admitted that the situation was perplexing. It was essential that the natives sh</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> work, &amp; this they w</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> only do under compulsion.
