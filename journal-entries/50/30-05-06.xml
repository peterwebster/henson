<hi>I wasted the morning in some attempts to prepare the address on Church and State to which I am pledged.</hi>

         <p>
<hi>Old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon Croudace</hi><hi> came to lunch.  He grows visibly feebler, and as he is more than fourscore, he cannot hold on much longer. I walked in the Park with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> McCullagh</hi><hi>.</hi>

         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Archdeacon Rawlinson</hi><hi> came to see me about G. and undertook to see how far it could be arranged that he should go to Mirfield.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> and I motored to Ryton, where I confirmed about 90 persons in the parish church.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Feddon</hi><hi> appears to be pleased with his present position: and, indeed, it is hard to imagine a more attractive parish.  The old Rectory House, mainly built in 1709, includes a garden front of the XV</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th </hi><hi>century. There is a large garden, which, I noticed with regret, is much neglected. The population is less than 3000, and tends to increase. But the wealthy residents are leaving the parish, &amp; they are being replaced by miners.</hi>
