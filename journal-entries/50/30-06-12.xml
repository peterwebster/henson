<hi>I actually succeeded in completing the Individualist Club address, though it needs a deal of revising, before it will be tolerable.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">A note from the Literary editor of the Daily Herald informs me that my article on "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Disestablishment</hi><hi rend="italic">" appeared in yesterday's issue of that paper, and that he is "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">arranging for a cheque to be sent to the Hon. Treasurer of the Durham Castle (Preservation) Fund in accordance with my request</hi><hi rend="italic">". A "Member of the House of Laity" replies in today's issue: but not, I think, effectively because he ignores the essential points, &amp; makes play with the secondary matters.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I walked round the Park with the Doctor. He had read my article, having seen a poster with my name on it.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charlie Lillingston</hi><hi> writes to me from Cambridge "My own nerves are constantly on edge, and it is often a dreadful effort to pull oneself together".  He is a gentle and affectionate fellow, and hardly physical strength enough to carry his mind and heart.  He would have made an admirable parson had his body been a more competent "sheath" for the "sword" of his spirit.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi><hi> and I motored to Durham, where we attended the Missionary Thanksgiving Service in the Cathedral which had been arranged by the Missionary Association.  It was quite an imposing function.  About a dozen bishops and a considerable body of the clergy, all robed, made a long procession.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Foss Westcott</hi><hi>,<persName xml:id="5474"></persName> the Metropolitan of India, was the preacher, and preached better than I had expected.  I gave the Benediction from the Throne.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> had to remain at Auckland in order to receive the Ordination candidates, but </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jack Carr</hi><hi> carried the pastoral staff.  After the service Ella and I returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Shaddick</hi><hi rend="italic"> has certainly put new life into the Missionary Association, which had become nearly moribund under his predecessor, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Wykes</hi><hi rend="italic">. But I cannot be altogether pleased with the constant and energetic effort to draw men to foreign service at a time when the Church is hopelessly undermanned at home. If the centre fail, will the circumference be unaffected? It is an uncomfortable question.</hi>
