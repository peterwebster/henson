<hi rend="doubleunderline">George Dennistoun</hi><hi> and his wife went off after breakfast.  I finished the second Edinburgh sermon â€“ a r&amp;#x00E9;chaaff&amp;#x00E9; of platitudes!  But one is "an ambassador in chains" when preaching in a Presbyterian pulpit.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi><hi> &amp; I motored to Winlaton where I confirmed about 150 persons, very evenly divided between the sexes.  Ill luck dogged us on our homeward journey, for the car 'struck work' on the hill on the entrance to Whickham.  We turned for help to Colonel </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Thompson</hi><hi>, and not in vain. A mechanic in the village, to whose garage the helpless car was dragged, undertook to remedy the mischief, and we were sent back to Auckland Castle in the Colonel's car, his chauffeur putting up with us for the night. We got home around 11.30 p.m. Incidentally we lighted on a vehement explosion between the Colonel and his Rector. I fear that Huthwaite is a hopelessly incompetent parson. His income is set down as &#x00A3;1100 and he does nothing.</hi>
