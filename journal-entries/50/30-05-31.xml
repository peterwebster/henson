<hi rend="doubleunderline">Rawlinson</hi><hi> celebrated in the Chapel at 8 a.m.  All the girls communicated.  I spent the morning in putting together an address for the clergy, when they come here on Monday.</hi>

<hi>In the afternoon Ella and I, picking up </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sybil</hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Eden</hi><hi>, at Windlestone, motored to Lambton in order to attend the annual meeting of the Durham County Nursing Association, which was hold in the great Hall of the castle.  There was a very large attendance, many having to stand.  </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Gainford</hi><hi> presided, &amp; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dame Edith Campbell</hi><hi> gave and address.  I proposed a vote of thanks to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Durham</hi><hi>, &amp; took occasion to say something about the ill effects of absenteeism. He is a shy man, amiable but, I judge, pathetically weak: and I doubt not that he is hard pressed financially. The "</hi><hi rend="underline">Lambton Boy</hi><hi>" is not yet sold, but he hopes it will by. He was not allowed to take his seat in the House because the late Earl, his father, had never done so. A vast amount of identifying "red&#8211;tape" was said to be necessary before he could be recognized as holding the peerage.</hi>
