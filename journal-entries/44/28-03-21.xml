<p><hi>The morning was wasted on the Conference Address. After lunch Lionel and I motored to Ryhope where I confirmed about 130 persons in the parish church. The disproportion in numbers between the sexes was distressing. After having tea with the Vicar, &amp; resting at the Vicarage, we went on to Sunderland, where I confirmed about 140 persons in S. Mark's Millfield. The numbers of the sexes were nearly equal. The church was crowded with a very attentive congregation, and the whole service pleased me. Evidently the Vicar, the Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> T. Romans, whom I appointed in 1922, is making good.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The Archbishop telegraphed an invitation to stay at Lambeth for the Convocation, but I replied that I was much pressed with Confirmations, &amp; did not intend to be present in Convocation.</hi>

<p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bishop Chandler</hi><hi rend="italic">, an extreme Anglo&#8211;Catholick, has a letter in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic"> strongly supporting </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Frere</hi><hi rend="italic">, and suggesting that the re&#8211;revised Prayer Book should be withdrawn.
