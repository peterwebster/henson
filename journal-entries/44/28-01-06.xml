<p><hi rend="bold">Friday, January 6</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Noel Storr</hi><hi> went off by an early train, &amp; his sister by a later.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I spent the whole morning in writing a review of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick Sheppard</hi><hi>'s absurd 'prophecy', "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Impatience of a Parson</hi><hi>". This with the Archbishops' Letter and my Sermon must suffice for the 'Bishoprick'.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The wind was violent until the evening. A tree by the bank of the Gaunless was blown down.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I received, and declined, a proposal that I should write the article on "The Church" in the new edition of the </hi><hi rend="underline">Encyclopoedia Brittannica</hi><hi>. </hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wilfrid Watson</hi><hi>, the Ordination Candidate from Shildon, who is now at S. John's, Durham, came to see me. He was 21 years old yesterday. I gave him a copy of "</hi><hi rend="underline">Godly Union &amp; Concord</hi><hi>", which I happened to have by me.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I read with much interest the book which Derry gave me at Christmas &#8211; '</hi><hi rend="underline">Pascal: the Man and the Message' by Roger H. Soltau M. A. Formerly Scholar of Pembroke College, Oxford</hi><hi>'. I had never heard of the writer before. He writes well, and, from diverse introductions, I should surmise that his point of view was that of a liberal&#8211;minded Anglo&#8211;Catholick.</hi>
