<p><hi>I worked at the Conference Address all the morning. In the afternoon Lionel and I motored to Barnard Castle, where I confirmed 22 boys in the School Chapel. This is the smallest number presented so far. We motored to Gateshead, where I confirmed 225 persons in S. James's Church. There was a very large congregation. This parish is extremely poor, but the present Rector, Hutton, an ex&#8211;Church Army officer, seems to be getting hold of the people. The churchwardens told me that there was still much unemployment. We returned to Auckland after the service, &amp; were hindered by the fog between Gateshead and Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street.</hi>

<p><hi rend="italic">The question of ordaining women to the Priesthood can be hardly be answered apart from the larger question of women's r√¥le in society. Is Sex a factor of such importance as to necessitate recognition, so that the issue may not properly turn on the competence of individuals? That Nature imposes a distinction of function is apparent: ought the distinction to involve an allocation of political &amp; social duties? To admit that it does is to disallow the whole tendency of post&#8211;war legislation.</hi>
