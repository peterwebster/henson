<p><hi>I succeeded in completing the Article on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bunyan</hi><hi> for "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Review of the Churches</hi><hi>", and sent it off to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Henry Lunn</hi><hi> by the afternoon post. Then I wrote a '</hi><hi rend="underline">Prefatory Note</hi><hi>" to the Conference Address, and sent both, together with my Address on the Castle at the Newcastle Meeting on March 14</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Carter</hi><hi> for '</hi><hi rend="underline">The Bishoprick</hi><hi>'.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>In the afternoon, I walked round the Park, and as I returned picked up two young men who turned out to be students. I showed them over the Castle, &amp; gave them, by way of memento, the sermons on '</hi><hi rend="underline">Continuity</hi><hi>'. Both were 'science men', &amp; had not Latin enough to translate </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lightfoot</hi><hi>'s inscription. And neither had so much as heard of Bishop </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Butler</hi><hi>!</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi><hi> came to dinner, and afterwards went with me to Newcastle, where I broadcast a brief appeal for Durham Castle. This went over the whole country, &amp; in theory was listened to by millions, but in fact how many did actually listen? And of these, how many will make any response?</hi>
