<p><hi>I spent most of the morning in the Club trying to make notes for the "Swanâ€“song" sermon which I so rashly promised. Then I walked to Westminster, &amp; lunched in the House of Lords. I called on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Storr</hi><hi>, &amp; had some talk with him.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I attended the debate on the Revised Prayer Book, which was adjourned from Monday night. There were many speakers, so that the debate continued after dinner. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The Lord Chancellor asked me to dine with him</hi><hi>. His house, with its rooms overlooking the River is quite charming. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Cave</hi><hi> shewed me many curious &amp; valuable articles of silver &amp; ivory which she had brought back from Zanzibar. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Cave</hi><hi> is an excellent fellow, &amp; most friendly, but his health is indifferent, &amp; I noticed that he ate nothing but invalid messes. I went back to the House for an hour after dinner. One good speech, by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Gorrell</hi><hi> from the Labour bench, was worth hearing, but the rest, including a desolating hour from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Carson</hi><hi>, was intolerably boring: so that, having arranged that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Earl Grey</hi><hi rend="underline"> should move the adjournment on my behalf</hi><hi>, I came away, and walked back to 21 Park Lane, feeling quite exhausted with the Oratory!</hi>
