<p><hi rend="bold">Monday, January 23</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>A most unpleasant day of wind and vehement rain. I worked at the Preface with which I propose to accompany the Cambridge Sermon, when it is published as a booklet by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The '</hi><hi rend="underline">Yorkshire Post'</hi><hi> has a leading article headed, '</hi><hi rend="underline">Authority of the Bishops'</hi><hi>, which discloses a clearer perception of the grave possibilities of the situation than this journal has hitherto shown. "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Bishop of Durham is not alone in having frankly faced that possibility (disestablishment</hi><hi>)".</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The '</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>' publishes a letter by the Bishop of Southwark making answer to the Bishop of Birmingham. It is none the less effective for being suave: but I fear that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><hi> is as pachdermatous as he is persistent and pugnacious.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I went into Durham, &amp; there presided over a meeting of the Church Building Board. After having tea with Knight, I returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Brook Westcott</hi><hi> and his wife arrived for a short visit, they had motored form Corby.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I sent a cheque to the Bursar of Wadham in payment of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi><hi>'s fees &amp; battels for the last term: &amp; I sent him the amount of his Union fee.</hi>
