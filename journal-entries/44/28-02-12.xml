<p><hi rend="bold">Sexagesima, February 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>A most beautiful morning, the sky suffused with brilliant amber light, and the crispness of frost in the air. There is an interest &amp; excitement in the birds' voices which is a prophecy of spring.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I got up, though by no means feeling well, and celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. The communicants numbered 9, including John.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="italic">I read through </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bell</hi><hi rend="italic">'s '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">The Modern Parson</hi><hi rend="italic">', and wrote to thank him for it, &amp; to express civilly my dissent from much that it contains &amp; assumes. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bell</hi><hi rend="italic"> is a good fellow, for whom I have a real liking, but he is swathed in the new conventionalism which treats the resolutions of a Lambeth Conference as binding spiritual pronouncements, and hails "Copec" as another Pentecost.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote pusillanimously to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh Macmillan</hi><hi>, telling him that I should not attend the meeting of the Home Office Committee next Friday, &amp; hinting that I might have to absent myself during the Confirmation Season.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>After dinner, for Lady Eden's benefit, I read aloud the oath against Modernists required by Pius X to be taken by all Ordination candidates &amp; clergy, &amp; now exacted. It fills 3 pages of an Appendix in the Dean of Canterbury's book.</hi>

<p><hi>'The Winchester monk's daily allowance of beer was six quarts, a little less than at some other great monasteries: not that he normally drank all this, but it helped him in the entertainment of friends and in other ways.'</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>(v. a Review in the Observer by G.G. Coulton. Sunday, February 12</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> 1928.)</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>With this may be compared the chapter on 'The Material Comfort of Monastic Life' in Snape's '</hi><hi rend="underline">English Monastic Finances</hi><hi>'. It is of S. Swithun's, Winchester, that the following statement is made:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>'Dean Kitchin calculates the daily allowance of meat alone at about a pound and a half per head.'</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Snape</hi><hi> gives his own verdict thus:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>"There is comparatively little in these later years to be seen </hi><hi rend="bold underline">beyond a life of easy sauntering comfort.</hi><hi> Though extravagant luxury might be absent, ease and plenty were not …… The monk lived comfortably, as comfort went then: he was provided with pocket money for luxuries, apart from those which the ordinary fare of the monasteries gave him …. On the whole, he lived a slow and well&#8211;to&#8211;do life."</hi>
