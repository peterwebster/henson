         </p>
<p><hi>My letter appears in the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> under the heading '</hi><hi rend="underline">Martyrdom &amp; Truth: a reply to Cardinal Bourne</hi><hi>". It reads well, but, perhaps, a little fiercely: though his Eminence really deserves it.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Selbourne</hi><hi> writes to me demurring my reference to the Enabling Act, for which he owes himself so largely responsible. I wrote a gentle reply to his Lordship. Then my work was interrupted by a visit from the Rector of Bishopwearmouth &amp; his Churchwarden. They brought a dolorous report of the Assistant Curate. When they had gone away, I motored into Durham, and took counsel with my Suffragan &amp; J. G. Wilson. Then I returned to Auckland for lunch.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I walked for an hour in the Park with Mcfarlens Grieve, who is secretary for the Castle Fund.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Then I had an extremely painful interview with the Assistant Curate of Bishopwearmouth, whose license was revoked.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I motored to Pelton, where I confirmed about 130 persons in the very mean &amp; ugly parish church. The Vicar, Wellesley&#8211;Wilkinson, looks like the curate in the 'Private Secretary', but was a naval chaplain. We returned to Auckland after the service.</hi>
