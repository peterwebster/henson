<p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, February 4</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1928.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I spent the whole morning over my correspondence which was rather urgent than important.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Then the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Gloucester</hi><hi> with his sister and nephew came to lunch with others; and I had some talk with him about the situation He and I appear to agree that any substantial alteration of the Measure would be disastrous. He has a letter to that effect in the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times.</hi><hi> It follows one of a precisely opposite character from the Solicitor General.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I walked for an hour in the Park. Dickson, the assistant curate from Tudhoe, came to see me. He wants to leave the parish in which he has been little more than 2 years. He gave an ill account of the work, or absence of work, in Tudhoe, and I fear that it may be true, but none the less he is a poor creature, &amp; worth very little.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I motored to Sunderland, and there in S. Andrew's, Roker, I inaugurated a Ten Days Mission by giving an address, and blessing the Missioner, Canon Peacock, who was formerly in this diocese as Vicar of Holy Trinity, Darlington. After the service we returned to Auckland, where we arrived at 9.50 p.m.</hi>
