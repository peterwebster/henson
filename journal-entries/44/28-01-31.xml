<p><hi>I occupied the morning in completing the Preface of the book, and arranging the material. The stuff was sent off to Hodder &amp; Stoughton.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I motored to Gateshead Fell, where I buried the old Vicar, the Rev. J. Mitchell, aged 87. He had been Vicar for 29 years. Most of the clergy of the Rural Deanery gathered to the Funeral. The weather was cruel, &amp; I got mortally cold at the grave&#8211;side.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The papers are filled with obituary notices of Earl Haig, who died suddenly last night. He was not either a great general or a great man, but he played his part manfully, did his very difficult duty honestly, and kept his honour unstained. We had some brief conversation in the House of Lords when we both voted for the Revised Prayer Book. That was my last sight of him.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="italic">That preposterous old fanatick, Lord Halifax, sends me, in pamphlet form, the article on "church &amp; state' which he contributed to the 'Church Times'. In it, he quotes in a garbled form some utterances of mine.</hi><hi> His approval stirs questionings in my mind as to the wisdom of the course I am taking!</hi>
