<p><hi rend="bold">Friday, December 9</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> gives much prominence to the Revised Prayer&#8211;Book, making it the subject both of a long communicated article and of its first leader. There are also several letters.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Arthur Headlam</hi><hi> has commented on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dicky Sheppard</hi><hi>'s foolish book with characteristic brutality. It is using a steam&#8211;hammer to crush a butterfly: and, in view of the said </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dicky</hi><hi>'s great personal popularity, it is extremely imprudent thus to alienate all his friends. Though, indeed, his book is mighty foolish.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I went in to Durham, and dedicated the altar which </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cruickshank</hi><hi> has set up in the Gallilee to the memory of her husband. There was a goodly company of invited friends, and the little service, though very brief, was also very reverent. I delivered a brief oration, in which </hi><hi rend="underline">I just alluded to the multiplication of altars in our churches as a practice which called for the careful consideration of the Church</hi><hi>. Personally, I dislike it, and doubt whether it can be safeguarded from misunderstanding and abuse. But it was no suitable occasion for enlarging on a contentious subject which yet I could not ignore.</hi>
         </p>

         </p>
<p><hi>Picking up </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie</hi><hi> at the College Gate, I motored to Sunderland, where I had an interview with the doctor who is attending the Rector, &amp; also with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pater</hi><hi>. There seems no likelihood that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pater</hi><hi> will ever recover his health sufficiently to carry on the work of the Parish, though he may survive in a wrecked state for some while. It is not improbable that his illness may end fatally within the next few weeks. I decided, therefore, that for the present we must await events, &amp; I promised to try and discover some man to do the parochial work. Then I went on to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wynne&#8211;Willson</hi><hi>, &amp; discussed the matter with him. Would the heavens fall if, in this shortage of suitable clergy, I authorized the closing of a parish during the illness of an incumbent, or during the vacancy of a living? A small payment to an adjoining incumbent would secure to the parishioners all that was indispensable, and a short suspension of services in the parish church could hardly inflict any serious or lasting injury on parochial religion. The subject merits my careful consideration.</hi>
