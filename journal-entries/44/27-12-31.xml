<p><hi rend="bold">New Year's Eve, December 31</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The hard frost still continues, but there are reports of a thaw in Scotland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote at some length to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Stamfordham</hi><hi> thinking it perhaps advisable that he should know where I stand in this difficult juncture. He will not be pleased to learn that I am little disposed to blink the essential issue.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Herd send me another immense telegram:</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Many thanks for letter. Fully appreciate your point of view. yours is a splendid idea. Please do not think of withdrawing proposal. The book you contemplate is vitally needed, and only you can write it. Go right on with book at once. Am coming north Tuesday. Can I call at Auckland Castle 4 p.m.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Evidently the gushing knave was rather startled to find that I didn't rise to his ''prophetic'' nonsense!</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I wrote to both the Archbishops, Lords Durham &amp; Scarborough &amp; others sending them good wishes for the New Year: &amp; then I cast up the account of 1927.</hi>

<p><hi>1927</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>This has been a year of rather disconnected activities. I wrote two Articles for the </hi><hi rend="underline">Edinburgh Review</hi><hi> and one in the </hi><hi rend="underline">Nineteenth Century &amp; After</hi><hi>. Also, I wrote five letters to the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>, and gave two public lectures viz. the </hi><hi rend="underline">Earl Grey Memorial Lecture</hi><hi> in Newcastle on Feb. 17</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, &amp; the lecture on </hi><hi rend="underline">Robert Louis Stevenson</hi><hi> in Edinburgh on November 12</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>. Also I wrote four articles for the </hi><hi rend="underline">Evening Standard.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">I made three speeches in the House of Lords</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi> I addressed 3 diocesan Conferences on </hi><hi rend="underline">Prayer Book Revision</hi><hi> viz. Durham, Newcastle, &amp; Carlisle, and spoke on the same subject in the meetings of the united Convocations (March 29</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>) and the Church Assembly (July 5</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>) when the Revised Book was adopted by great majorities. I preached to a great gathering of Freemasons in </hi><hi rend="underline">York Minster</hi><hi> on July 5</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: at the 800</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> centenary of </hi><hi rend="underline">Furness Abbey</hi><hi> on July 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: to the </hi><hi rend="underline">Church Congress</hi><hi> at Ipswich on October 4</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: in </hi><hi rend="underline">Westminster Abbey</hi><hi> on Oct. 30</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: and in </hi><hi rend="underline">S. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh</hi><hi> on November 13</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>This year completed 40 years of my Ministry in the church of England. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I marked the fact by printing &amp; presenting to the clergy a small volume of sermons &amp; Ordination Addresses entitled</hi><hi> '</hi><hi rend="underline">Church &amp; Person in England</hi><hi>'. The </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishoprick</hi><hi> acquired a large measure of publick importance through </hi><hi rend="bold">[44] </hi><hi rend="italic">my article on the Revised Prayer Book. The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Auckland Brotherhood</hi><hi rend="italic"> met here on the day of the Sun's eclipse. My wife and I celebrated our '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Silver Wedding</hi><hi rend="italic">', &amp; received many tokens of affection. Three of my friends died during the year &#8211; </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Arthur Johnson</hi><hi rend="italic">, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Sir Henry Craik</hi><hi rend="italic">, and </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Cruickshank</hi><hi rend="italic">. I have come into closer relations with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the fact has tended to raise my estimate of his Grace's character. My advocacy of the Revised Prayer Book has alienated many who assumed too rashly that I held with their Protestant fervours. The controversy raised by </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><hi rend="italic"> has placed ^a severe^ </hi><hi rend="i bold">(</hi><hi rend="italic"> and excessive </hi><hi rend="i bold">)</hi><hi rend="italic"> strain on my personal friendship with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><hi rend="italic"> himself, and with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Inge</hi><hi rend="italic">: </hi><hi rend="i bold">(</hi><hi rend="italic"> and I can see that the rift is destined to grow wider </hi><hi rend="i bold">)</hi><hi rend="italic">. In the diocese there is only </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">the completion of the repair of Escombe church to be recorded in the credit scale</hi><hi rend="italic">, save perhaps for a slight improvement in the matter of Ordination Candidates. The diminution in the number of working clergy continues, and the fact is certainly telling badly on every part of the church's work. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">In fact, the diocese is running down, &amp; the situation moves quickly towards a deadlock</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi>
