<p><hi>The day was wet and "muggy", I had a sleepless night, &amp; felt a poor creature. After breakfast I walked to the Club, &amp; spent the morning in arranging my speech. I lunched, &amp;then walked to the hair&#8211;dresser, &amp; was made respectable for my performance in the House. Then I walked to Westminster, &amp; </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">at 3.25 p.m. began my speech. I spoke for exactly 45 minutes, and was well listened to throughout The House presented a magnificent spectacle, for the benches, Lady's Gallery, Public Gallery, Bar, &amp; Throne were all crowded. I received many congratulations when I sate own. The Archbishop of Canterbury said it was a 'great speech'. Lord Salisbury said the peroration was 'magnificent. Many others, including Margot, were equally complimentary. I don't know what may be the truth, but the general verdict seemed favourable</hi><hi>. The Bishop pf Norwich was not effective. Lord Cave made a short but useful speech. Then the Archbishop of York would up. He spoke well, but was, perhaps, a little too long. The division was taken at 7.15 p.m. There were 241 in favour of the resolution, and no more than 88 against &#8211; a notable triumph.</hi>

<p><hi>Lord Durham was there. He &amp; I voted together. Lords Londonderry, Barnard, Ravensworth, Gainsford, &amp; Scarborough also voted in the majority, so that the diocese did its duty </hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lord Scarbrough took me with Lady Scarbrough to dine with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Rockford Maguire. Lord Stanmore was the other guest. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Mine hostess told me that Lord Birkenhead had expressed great approval of my speech. Some peer paid me the dubious compliment of saying that I was 'the Birkenhead of the Episcopate'</hi><hi>!! Old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Halifax</hi><hi>, aged 88, was in the House. I helped him to his seat, for he is very infirm: &amp; he said some kind things about my speech, but </hi><hi rend="bold underline">himself abstained from voting</hi><hi>. After the division, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Ernle</hi><hi>, formerly </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">R. E. Prothero</hi><hi>, congratulated me on my speech, and, pointing at </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi><hi>, said, "</hi><hi rend="underline">To think that I examined both of you for Fellowships</hi><hi>!" It is a wonderful way that both of us have been led &#8211; an unknown Scotch lad from Glasgow, and a still more unknown lad from Broadstairs, &amp; in one of the greatest debates of modern times in the House of Lords, playing leading r√¥les, the one speaking as the selected representative of the English Episcopali, the other summing up the debate!</hi>
