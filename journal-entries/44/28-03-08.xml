<p><hi>I had an hour's interview with the Estates Committee of the Ecclesiastical Commission, and expounded the case of Durham Castle. In reply to a question, how much in my opinion ought to be granted, I replied that £25,000 would to my thinking not be excessive. They were civil, even friendly, but entirely non–committal!</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Then I had lunch with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Geoffrey Dawson</hi><hi> &amp; his wife in Sussex Place. I did my best to get Geoffrey to pledge himself to divers helpful procedures, but, beyond rather vague assurances of support, I gained little.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I returned to Auckland by the 5.30 p.m. express. Rawson came into the carriage, &amp; talked much and interestingly about many things. He takes a far more depressed view of the industrial outlook in Durham than heretofore. Evidently, Bollum, Vaughan &amp; C. are not making much headway yet. Lionel met me with the car at Darlington. On arriving at the Castle, I found among my letters one from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Owen Seamen</hi><hi> asking me to get in touch with the Punch draughtsmen. This will be another journey to town!</hi>
