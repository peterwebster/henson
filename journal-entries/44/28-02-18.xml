<p><hi>In fact, with regard to all that Paul the tentmaker has to say about </hi><hi rend="underline">labour</hi><hi>, we ought to place ourselves as it were within S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's own class, the artisan class of the Imperial age, and then feel the force of his words. They all become more life&#8211;like when restored to their original historical </hi><hi rend="underline">milieu</hi><hi>.</hi>

<p><hi>The chapter 'S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul the Man' in Deissmann's 'S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul A study in Social and Religious History' emphasizes the unimportance of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul in his own age. Yet in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible, I read as follows:&#8211; 'The wealth of Paul's father we may fairly infer from the education given him: his occupation as a tentmaker is no disproof of this, for well&#8211;to&#8211;do Jews wisely taught their sons some handicraft'. I prefer to think of S. Paul as the only 'gentleman &amp; scholar' in the Apostolic college, &amp;, </hi><hi rend="underline">therefore</hi><hi>, its most influential teacher: for even 'the Prince of the Apostles' learned from him. The admirable Deissmann exaggerates the certainly considerable contribution he has made to N v T [sic] studies, &amp; his enthusiasm for the testimony of papyri and ostraca [sic] almost creates a 'bee in his bonnet'.</hi>
