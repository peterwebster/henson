         </p>
<p><hi>At the Restoration the Prayer Book was revised by the Convocations, and passed without detailed discussion by Parliament, at that time a Christian assembly. The House of Commons did indeed record an assertion of its right to alter, but did not exercise that right. In fact Parliament played the rôle of a House of Unity, which in the circumstances of the time it was qualified to play.</hi>

<p><hi>I spent the morning on the Committee, where we sate </hi><hi rend="underline">in camerǎ</hi><hi>, &amp; heard the evidence of the Governor&amp; Chaplains of Wormwood Scrubs. They have only male prisoners there: &amp; </hi><hi rend="underline">they</hi><hi> seem to be a very distinct type.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>After lunching at the Club, &amp; writing to Ella, I went to Liverpool Street, &amp; took train for Cambridge. My companion was a talkative old gentleman, </hi><hi rend="underline">who combines a peerage with the Mastership of Peterhouse, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Chalmers</hi><hi>. He talked incessantly all the way, &amp;, as his utterance is not very distinct, &amp; the noise of the train was considerable, the strain of listening was great. I felt completely exhausted by the time we arrived in Cambridge.</hi>

         </p>
<p><hi>There was a pleasant dinner party, which included the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Burkitts</hi><hi> and the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Creads</hi><hi>. It was only when everyone had departed that I realised that M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cread </hi><hi>was a daughter of Canon </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lilley. </hi><hi>What a calamity it is to have a memory so capricious and untrustworthy!</hi>

<p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Clapham</hi><hi rend="italic"> the economist, was also present, and with him I had some conversation. He is a large, beardless man, with a professional air and manner. After the guests had gone their several ways, I had some talk with mine host on ecclesiastical matters. He expressed himself very reasonably, but this circumstance is a poor guarantee that he is reasonable. He exhibited repugnance, when I related </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lady Ullswater</hi><hi rend="italic">'s account of the performance in All Saints, Margaret Street, and immediately identified it as a copy of the function in the Ara Coeli in Rome, where the Bambino is similarly presented for the adoration of the faithful. M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs </hi><hi rend="italic">Weeks, who seems to be considerably older than her husband, is also an Anglo&#8211;Catholick.</hi>
