         </p>
<p><hi>Snow fell during the night so that there was a "white Christmas" after all. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 19 altogether, including the 3 Bryden boys &amp; Horrie. We motored to South Church, and there I preached at Mattins, &amp; afterwards celebrated the Holy Communion. There were about 60 communicants, among whom were Kenneth, and his mother.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>We motored to Durham, &amp; attended Evensong in the Cathedral. I occupied the Throne, &amp; pronounced the Benediction after 3 carols had been admirably sung by the Choir. Then I gave Christmas Boxes to the five vergers, the senior sub&#8211;verger. an almsman, the porter, the park&#8211;keeper, &amp; the girl at the White Gate. This cost me &#x00A3;9. We had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow, and returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>After dinner Ella and Fearne came to my room, and, according to my custom on Christmas Day, I read aloud to them Milton's Ode on the Nativity. Who can dare say that the 20</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century is superior to the 17</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> with that Music in his ears? Then Ella read to me for an hour, and so I brought one more Christmas to an end. </hi>
