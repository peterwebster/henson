<p> 
<hi>A beautiful mild morning, almost spring like. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 7 communicants including Bridget Tallento.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I revised an old sermon for use in Sedgefield later in the day: and wrote to William and Frank Berry in South Africa. </hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Bridget and I walked in the Park before lunch.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>An Irish&#8211;ordained parson who has served in America, named Hamilton, came to lunch. He aspires to join the staff in Bishop Auckland. He talked much in the Irish way about Union in Canada between the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists. He thought that it was unreal, &amp; even farcical: but I suspect that he is neither well&#8211;informed nor just.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>We all motored to Sedgefield, where we had tea in the Rectory, and then attended Evensong in the Parish Church. I preached the sermon. There was but a moderate congregation, though the night was fine, and there was a bright moon. The electric light has been installed in the church since my last visit. After service, we returned to Auckland.</hi>
