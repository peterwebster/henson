<p><hi>The Dean of Westminster has an article on Disestablishment in the </hi><hi rend="underline">Church Family Newspaper</hi><hi>. It sounds a note of caution, even of retreat. The Dean of Durham writes characteristically to the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> repeating all the hackneyed objections against the Revised Prayer Book as if they were discoveries of his own, which the pressure of a troubled conscience compels him to impart to the public. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Weldon</hi><hi>'s notion of "coming to the help of Lord against the mighty" is an odd one.</hi>

<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady </hi><hi>Wrightson and her son </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">John</hi><hi> came to lunch, &amp; were shown over the Castle. The lad seems very intelligent. After they had taken their leave, I walked round the Park with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Ella &amp; Fearne with two young officers from Catterick went off to dine with old M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Kirk in Norton, &amp; go to a dance, which his daughter is promoting nominally in aid of the local hospital. Lionel &amp; I dined together.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>The whole day has been wasted because I cannot make up my mind whether to write, or what to write about this miserable "crisis". Something, perhaps, I owe to my friends, in whose eyes, naturally but nonetheless unjustly, I seem to have abandoned the Protestant Cause, of which they were fools enough to imagine I was a champion.</hi>
