         </p>
<p><hi>A considerable snow&#8211;fall during the night had invested the country with 'the saintly veil of maiden white', and I had the doubtful joy of contemplating a rare scene of winter&#8211;fashioned beauty when I looked out from my windows.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I dictated to Lionel an address on the Castle for the Broad&#8211;casting people, and finished a sermon for the Shildon Freemasons largely dealing with the same theme.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Ella and Lionel accompanied me to Stockton, where I "opened" a Palestine Exhibition, &amp; afterwards had an interview with the churchwardens of the Parish Church, who desired to lay before me the condition of the parish in view of my appointing a new Rector. The Rural Dean (Douglas) told me that he had arranged to have the communicants from the vacant parish of Long Newton to be brought to </hi>

<p><hi>Stockton by motor&#8211;omnibus on Easter Day as it was not possible to find a priest to celebrate Holy Communion in Long Newton itself. That is a significant indication of the gravity of the shortage of clergy. </hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>More snow fell at intervals during the day, &amp; by nightfall there was a good deal on the ground.</hi>
