<p><hi>The newspapers give some prominence to my Address to the Diocesan Conference, but show a disposition, as regrettable as it was probably inevitable, to represent it as an "attack" on the Feminist Movement. The '</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>', however, more reasonably throws the emphasis on my observations about the duty of the minorities to accept the Revised Prayer Book, if &amp; when it shall become law.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>I motored to Darlington, and opened the Palestine Exhibition. Lord Gainford was in the chair, and there was a large attendance. Of the clergy I observed none except Drury &amp; his curate, Richardson, &amp; Ball. Immediately on the conclusion of the opening function I returned to Auckland.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I motored to Rainton, where I confirmed 93 persons. The church was filled: the congregation was attentive: &amp; the candidates seemed to be impressed. This was the last appearance at a confirmation of the Rector, Rawlins, who is about to resign. He asked me for a signed photograph, &amp; I had not the heart to refuse him. He is a cranky angular creature, &amp; he came to the parish by exchange: but in his way he has laboured, &amp; there can be no doubt that he has had much to put up with.</hi>
