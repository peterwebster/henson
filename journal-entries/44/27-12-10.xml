<p><hi>" This rubric is not in the liturgy of Queen Elizabeth, nor confirmed by law; nor is there any great need of restoring it, the world now being in more danger of profanation than of idolatry. Besides, the sense of it is declared sufficiently in the 28</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> Article of the Church of England."</hi>

<p><hi>v. The Answer of the Bishops to the Exceptions of the Ministers A.D. 1661 (v. Documents relating to the Act of Uniformity p. 166)</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi><hi> writes to me about "this precious Black Rubric", "It is amazing to find the importance which is attached to this in all sorts of unexpected quarters." Evidently his Grace has "got the wind up": and no doubt the Opposition are making prodigious efforts to impress Parliament. Nevertheless, I cannot think that there is any real danger that the Resolution will be rejected in either House.</hi>

She is an enthusiastick supporter of Bishop Barnes.</hi>

<p><hi>The 'Durham University Journal' for December 1927 contains Canon Richard's Inaugural Lecture in Durham. Its subject is "The present position and future outlook of classical studies", and it is very interesting and informing. He calls Durham Cathedral "the greatest cathedral of Christendom".</hi>

<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Leslie</hi><hi> came to see me. He hopes to get post as a footman with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Major Ropner</hi><hi>. I shall be glad when he has steady work again.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi>Then I set to the comfortless task of preparing for my departure. The tearing up of letters &amp;c is an odious business.</hi>
         </p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Temple</hi><hi> has sent me a copy of his Diocesan magazine which contains his Presidential Address to the Manchester Diocesan Conference on "the Church and Reunion". He does not really move beyond the familiar Anglican position. His view of the Episcopate, though more moderately phrased, still keeps that form of ecclesiastical polity in the list of essentials. "What above most things we have to remember is our horrible sin of negligence in failing to found an Episcopate in America. We would not send Bishops."</hi>
