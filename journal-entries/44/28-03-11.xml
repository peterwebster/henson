<p><hi>There was more snow during the night. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 7 comm</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi><hi>. Including John. The snow fell in vehement blizzards all through the day, and by night fall the roads were encumbered by considerable drifts.</hi>

<p><hi>I motored to New Shildon, and preached to about 60 Freemasons. The lodges from outside the parish were hindered from coming by the snow. I was sorry for Morris Young, who had taken great pains in arranging the service.</hi>

<p><hi rend="italic">The necessity of throwing myself into this very difficult and doubtful venture of raising a vast sum (&#x00A3;100,000) to save the Castle is really a first&#8211;class misfortune. For not only does it make a great demand on my time &amp; energies, at a juncture when both are far too little for my proper tasks, but it empties my pocket, and discourages our own people.</hi>
