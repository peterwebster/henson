<p><hi>In 1528 &#8211; just 400 years ago &#8211; Tyndal put forth his '</hi><hi rend="underline">Obedience of a Christian Man &amp; how Christian Rulers ought to govern</hi><hi>' in which he defends Protestants from the charge of being bad subjects, &amp; attacks the clergy &amp; the Papal system. This may fit in to the general plan of a sermon designed to deal with the principles at stake in the conflict between Church &amp; State, which the rejection of the Revised Prayer Book by the House of Commons has precipitated. Henry viii, to whom Anne Boleyn is said to have shown Tyndale's book, was delighted with it. "This book is for me &amp; all kings to read" &#8211; he said.</hi>
