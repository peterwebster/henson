<p><hi rend="italic">I walked in the Park, and there fell in with miner with whom I got into conversation. He was evidently a man of superior intelligence, considerable reading, and a gift of humour. He had read a good deal of history, geography, astronomy, and fiction. His modes of expression were so racy and vigourous,that I would have given much to reproduce them. He said that he had never been into the Castle, so I brought him in &amp; shewed him the Chapel &amp; State&#8211;room. His admiration was great, &amp; he uttered it freely. I wonder how many ordinary English gentlemen, bred at a public school &amp; university, would have equalled this poor man in their knowledge &amp; appreciation of the things of the mind.</hi>
