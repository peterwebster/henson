<hi>A fine day, miserably wasted in this tiresome and futile Committee.<note xml:id="351" n="1"></note></hi> <hi rend="bold underline">My motion to omit the paragraph about the "inherent" authority of bishops was defeated by 24 to 7.

It is very good reading, and gives the impression that the author was of a vivacious, candid, original disposition. I attended a meeting of dissentients with a view to framing a Minority Report, but it did not look very promising.</hi>
