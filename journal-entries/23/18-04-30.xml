<hi rend="bold underline">I attended the Convocation, &amp; took part in the discussions</hi><hi>. My speeches were unsuccessful &amp; unwise, especially in the afternoon, when I followed the Bishop of Lichfield<persName xml:id="3831"></persName> on the motion of the Bishop of Peterborough<persName xml:id="3933"></persName>. The Bishops of Oxford<persName xml:id="49"></persName> &amp; Winchester<persName xml:id="105"></persName> were more to the general taste. How hollow &amp; futile these discussions are!</hi>

<hi>I lunched with Gow<persName xml:id="216"></persName>: and had tea with Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName>. After dining at the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>,</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">I walked to the Queen' Hall, and attended a meeting of the Church Reform League<orgName xml:id="284"></orgName>, convened to listen to a discussion of a reform of our present system of appointing bishops. My presence on the platform had perhaps a depressing effect on the speakers</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> The Bishop of London<persName xml:id="166"></persName> mainly declared the excellencies of the present system, &amp; the relative failure of the elective systems in the colonial churches! After this Balaam's speech,</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">the Bishop of Oxford took up his parable</hi><hi>: he also was strangely unconvincing. Then followed a large man named Kemp<persName xml:id="4399"></persName>, &amp; then the Dean of Lincoln<persName xml:id="545"></persName>. There did not seem to be much genuine enthusiasm. I walked back to Garland's under a maze of searchâ€“lights.</hi>
