<persName xml:id="2267">General Gordon</persName> marked with doubled pencil line the last three lines. Who does not endorse the affirmation which he thus disclosed? The practical paradox – the higher you rise, the nearer you fall – is fulfilled in lesser men than the Hero–Saint of the Sudan!</p>

The Cathedral looked very beautiful in the morning sunlight. There was but a small congregation at Mattins: had the Grammar school boys been absent the nakedness of the land would have been very marked. The service consisted of Mattins, Litany, Ante–Communion Office, &amp; Sermon – all unaccompanied. According to a custom of some standing the Preacher was the Sacrist. He preached quite pleasantly. After service I wrote at some length to <persName xml:id="1567">Symonds</persName> of Montreal with reference to his difficulty with the <persName xml:id="3193">Bishop</persName> on account of preaching in a Presbyterian Church.</p>

There was a very fairly numerous congregation in the Cathedral at Evensong, more numerous by far than I had ventured to expect, as the University has gone down, the boys don't attend the afternoon service, &amp; the faithful have been mostly going to the "Three Hours" service in one or other of the city churches. I preached an old sermon on S. John xix.12,16 making a study of Pontius Pilate, as he is disclosed in the record of the Passion.</p>
