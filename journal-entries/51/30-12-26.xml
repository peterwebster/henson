         </p>
         <p>A boisterous unpleasant morning, with intermittent &amp; vehement essay at snow.  </p>
         <p>I worked at the Cathedral Sermon, but with greater reluctance of brain and heart than usual.  Is it that I really have no word of hope, or counsel, or warning, or encouragement at the start of the year?  Certainly I never felt so spiritually and mentally exhausted before: <hi rend="underline">"why are thou so vexed O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?  O put thy trust in God : for I will yet thank Him, which is the help of my countenance, and my God".</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>I walked round the Park in the slush of melting snow. There was nobody there.</p>
         <p> I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gilbert</hi>, sending also the <hi rend="underline">'Bishoprick'</hi>, my pamphlet on "<hi rend="underline">Church &amp; State in England</hi>", and the Mezzotint engraving of my portrait.  </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Brilioth</hi>'s Book, translated into English under the title "<hi rend="underline">Eucharistic Faith &amp; Practice, Evangelical and Catholic</hi>", which he sent to me as a Christmas gift, is a very thorough piece of work.  I wish that my Brother in Birmingham could be induced to 'read, mark, learn &amp; inwardly digest' it. </p>
