         <p>The fog still hangs over the country, but is not enough to hinder movement.</p>
         <p>Charles motored me to Durham, where I presided at a meeting of the Conference Committee.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lomax</hi> was more <hi rend="underline">loquacious</hi> than usual.  His appetite for talk is insatiable, &amp; he succeeded in carrying a motion in favour of an invited speaker in addition to the Budget at the "Business meeting" of the Conference.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi> and I walked to the County Club, where I signed the portrait of myself, which the Club has purchased.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i doubleunderline">Jarrow</hi><hi rend="italic"> has not yet succeeded in 'placing' the hapless and hopeless </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi><hi rend="italic">, and now his resignation has taken effect, he is penniless.  </hi><hi rend="italic underline">We</hi><hi rend="italic"> must maintain him, his wife, &amp; 4 children in order to avert the scandal of their destitution!  This is the method of enforcing discipline in the Church of England viz. penalizing the judge!  A married clergy adds its own formidable difficulties to the general problem, which in itself is difficult enough.  What shall be done with the disgraced and evicted parson?</hi>
