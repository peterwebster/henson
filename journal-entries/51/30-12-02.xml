<hi rend="bold">Tuesday, December 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I wasted the morning in writing a foolish little article, "<hi rend="underline">Of the Pitfall of Mistaken Identity</hi>", for the "<hi rend="underline">Eclipse</hi>", which is the Durham School magazine.  I was led to this folly by an earnest request from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi>.</p>

         <p>
<hi rend="italic">My letter appeared in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times </hi><hi rend="italic">under the heading, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Church and State. The Birmingham Moral</hi><hi rend="italic">". It does not wholly please me, but it says some necessary things, and say them unmistakeably.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>After lunch I walked round the Park with Charles and D<hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi>McCullagh, and, on my return to the Castle, lent to the latter Oke's '<hi rend="underline">Basketfull of Memories</hi>', and Inge's '<hi rend="underline">Christian Mysticism</hi>'. At least that old man has retained, for the solace of unemployed old age, an omnivorous appetite for books.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Davison</hi>, the wife of the Vicar of S. Helen's, West Auckland, was knocked down by a motor in the street outside the Vicarage, &amp;, according to the evening paper, was badly shaken.  As she is both elderly and substantial, such a shaking may well be serious.  The perils of the streets grow greater daily, &amp; the toll of death and mutilation rises steadily.</p>
