         <p>I wrote letters of condolence to Leonard Ropner, and to Miss Marsh, the sister of the Vicar of Tudhoe Grange. Words are not worth much in the dark days of grief.</p>
         <p>Ella and I left the Castle at 11 a.m., and motored by way of Stockton and Guiseborough, to Danby where we lunched with <hi rend="doubleunderline">George Macmillan</hi> &amp; his wife.  "<hi rend="doubleunderline">Tubby" Clayton</hi> was staying there, very debonnair [sic], saponaceous, and clerical. Of course, the world's salvation is bound up with 'Toc H.'!  The day was brilliant, and the moors looked their best: but I was unable to enjoy either because of a vehement attack of dyspepsia! On our return journey we visited the new memorial church designed by Templemore. It was dignified and devotional, but apparently in debt for the building to the tune of &#x00A3;1500. I suppose the money has been guaranteed in order to enable the consecration of the building to take place.</p>
         <p>I received from Sir Henry Lunn an invitation to join the Hellenic Travellers' Cruize [sic] in the Mediterranean next year, and to give a lecture. I promptly declined the proposal.</p>
