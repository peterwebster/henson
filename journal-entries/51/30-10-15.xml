         <p>Charles drove me into Durham where I first instituted or rather licensed curates in the Castle, and then, after lunching in my rooms, presided at a meeting of the Board of Finance.  Then I had conference with the two Archdeacons and Ferens about Pelton.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Chancellor Errington</hi> had sent his "opinion" on the points submitted to him by<hi rend="doubleunderline"> Lazenby</hi> &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ferens</hi>, &amp; he had drafted a letter for me to send to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi>.  This was duly sent, &amp; also a letter to the Churchwardens.  I had received a letter from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi>'s brother, giving an ill account of him, &amp; offering to assist in taking duty at Pelton.</p>
         <p>At 5.30 p.m. I attended the lecture on  Virgil given by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Professor Richmond</hi> of Edinburgh.  It was admirable &amp; admirably expressed.</p>
         <p>At 8 p.m. I dined in the Hall of the Castle as the Vice Chancellor's guest.  There were about 35 persons dining.  I read my speech in proposing the toast of "The Memory of Vergil". I think it was approved.</p>
