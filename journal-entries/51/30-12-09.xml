         <p>Ella is reported to be distinctly better: but she seems curiously depressed about herself.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">I wrote to Derek</hi> at some length in answer to his letter.  It was too direct an appeal for spiritual guidance to be either postponed, or treated lightly.  Then I resumed work on the "Charge".</p>
         <p>Charles and I motored to Dirham, where we had tea with the Principal &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Braley; and then I confirmed seven of the students in the College Chapel.  Save for the persistent coughing of one man, the attention was good, and the service impressive. I had some speech with the young men afterwards. Then we went to the College in order to pick up M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Quirk, and bring her on for a visit to Auckland.  I saw the Bishop of Jarrow for a few minutes, and heard with much relief that he hoped to find a settlement for <hi rend="doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi> in the diocese of Carlisle.  I shall be devoutly thankful when that tiresome fellow has finally left the diocese.</p>
         <p>There is a hard frost.</p>
