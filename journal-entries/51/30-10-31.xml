         <p>I spent the morning on the Redcar speech. My difficulty is, not the paucity, but the plenitude of material. After lunch, I motored to Durham, and, there presided over the Education Board.  It was not a pleasant meeting, for the "Die–hards" – Lomax, Leake, Cosgrave, and Tymms – were very insistent, and gave me to know in clear terms that they thought me pusillanimous &amp; unfaithful in not exerting myself "to save the schools".  But <hi rend="doubleunderline">Colonel Thomlinson</hi>,<persName xml:id="5284"></persName> the Treasurer, made a very clear statement, showing that we really had no money, &amp; no expectation of money; and I thought it advisable to "put my foot down".  I said that <hi rend="underline">I would not sanction any appeal for the schools, and, on the whole the Board supported me : Though they dearly love the luxury of tall–talking, and are brought to give it up with difficulty!</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>After the meeting, I motored to Newcastle, where I recovered my watch, &amp; visited the hair dresser.  After tea, in the Hotel, I returned to Auckland.  Leslie Wilson came to see me.  He has a fortnight's holiday, &amp; is visiting his home.  He is very loyal to the Castle.  </p>
