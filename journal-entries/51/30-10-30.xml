<hi rend="italic">Charles drove me to Durham, where I presided at a meeting of the Lay helpers Association, and afterwards I had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow, and walked in the Banks.

He seemed to have assumed that I would retire on reaching the age of seventy i.e. in 1933: and expressed his own wish to retire, &amp; devote himself to literary work.
