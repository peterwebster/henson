         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am somewhat perplexed how to answer your letter, for, while it is certainly true that my diocese grievously needs an increase of clergy, and that, for that reason, I desire Ordination candidates, yet, for many weighty considerations, I do not wish to give any kind of official recognition to the 'Brotherhood of S. Paul, Little Bardfield', which does not satisfy the conditions laid down by the English Episcopate for clerical training.</p>
         <p>If your young friend will fill up, as far as he can, the enclosed form, and return it to me, I will consider his case carefully, and, if it seems to be advisable, will ask him to come and see me.</p>
         <p>Believe me &amp;c</p>
         <p>Herbert Dunelm:</p>
         <p>The Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> W. H. O. Schofield</p>
         <p>West Holme, Shepley, Huddersfield.</p>

         <p>My dear Sir David Hunter Blair,</p>
         <p>It is really kind of you to send me your very interesting article, which I am pleased to possess.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Anthony Bek</hi> seems to me the most perfect example of the Feudal Prelate which the record of the Medieval Church contains.  We have his "Sword" in Auckland Castle.  It is more a dagger than a sword: and is inscribed '<hi rend="underline">Antonius Ep. Dunolm</hi>:'  That spelling is, I am informed, a very ancient form.  The antiquarians hold the blade to be genuine, but not the hilt, which does not seem to be more ancient that the xvii<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century.</p>
         <p>There is a sinister (but so far unconfirmed) report that much of the ancient Percy lands will have to be sold in order to pay the Estate duty.  The silent operation of that ill&#8211;advised impost is working an agrarian revolution <hi rend="bold">[45]</hi> in Great Britain: but whether for the benefit, or for the injury of the Country, who dare say?</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Yours v. sincerely</p>
         <p>Herbert Dunelm:</p>
         <p>The Very Reverend<lb/>Sir David Hunter Blair Bt.<lb/>Belmont Abbey<lb/>Hereford.</p>
         <p>I have no notion what is the proper style of a Roman Catholic Abbott, so I address him as if he were an Anglican Dean, which can hardly be regarded as inadequate, still less as deliberately discourteous.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Steele&#8211;Maitland</hi> kindly caused a fire to be lighted in mine host's study, and there I spent the morning in writing letters, &amp; thinking (not very serviceably) over the various sermons and addresses to which I am pledged during the next few weeks. How I am to get through my programme of such work without publicly discrediting myself is hard to see.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Kingsley Martin, the literary editor of the Political Quarterly writes, asking me to send him the Article, "Ought the Establishment to be maintained?" to this address:&#8211; 20 Kingston Road, Didsbury, Manchester.  The envelope bears the stamp of 'The Manchester Guardian'. What am I to infer from this?</p>
         <p>There came to tea a Colonel Monro<hi rend="strikethrough">e</hi> who was the brother of General Munro, who married Miss Troutbeck.  He professed to have met me in Westminster years ago.</p>
         <p>Mary (M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> O'Brien) took me to see the Trout Fishery, and talked with the utmost freedom about her position, plans, and opinions.  She is devoted to her infant son, and would like him to have brothers &amp; sisters: but cannot see how her husband &amp; she can afford more children.  I suppose her case is widely representative.  The assumption is that boys must be sent to <hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>one of<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> the great &amp; more expensive public schools, and then to Oxford or Cambridge: &amp; on this assumption the small family appears to be required.</p>
