<hi rend="doubleunderline">Prof. Heawood</hi> writes to tell me that the <hi rend="underline">Pilgrims' Trust</hi> has voted £<hi rend="doubleunderline">25,000</hi> to the Castle Preservation Fund.  This is indeed good news.   It will enable me to leave that business alone: for my successor must take it up again when more funds are needed.</p>
         <p>I received from Downing a further communication about the work on Park Gates House: and I replied at once accepting the scheme drafted by Caröe.</p>
         <p>I motored to Newcastle, and had my hair cut: also, I ordered a pair of shoes with thick soles for walking in the Park: also, I left the Mezzotint engraving of my portrait at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, with a note to the Secretary, bidding him have the said engraving framed at my expense: also, I left my spectacles at the Oculists that their frames might be repaired.  Then I had tea at the Hotel, and so returned to Auckland.</p>
