         <p>A hard frost, and the roads by no means easy. I spent the morning in working at the Charge. In the afternoon I walked round the Park, and fell in with young Wilkinson, who has just come down from Cambridge. He wanted to know whether I would come to the University next May, and introduce a debate in the Union next May on Disestablishment.  I declined.  Then I put together notes for a speech to the boys of Dame Allan's School in Newcastle, which I delivered later. There was a crowded room.  The Vicar of Newcastle presided, &amp; was supported by the Lord Mayor &amp; Sheriff. The Headmaster (Wilson) held forth for nearly 50 minutes &amp; was intolerably dull and prolix. I spoke for about 25 minutes after distributing the prizes.  My speech was much applauded, &amp; ridiculously praised.  But it served well enough.  I got away by 9.20 p.m., and was just an hour in returning to the Castle.  The question always presents itself.  Is this kind of performance really worth while?  Possibly it creates for me a kind of position in the general mind which facilitates my diocesan work. I am not sure. That the amount of time &amp; labour expended is very considerable is not to be questioned. </p>
