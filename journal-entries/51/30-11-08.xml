         <p>A brilliant day, mild and almost spring like. My post was swollen by "Birthday letters" from a quaint collection of friends, new and old.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Jack Cass</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Derek</hi> sent me their photographs.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi> sent me some of his heather honey.  Charles gave me a knife: and Fearne, nail&#8211;scissors. The following wrote to me:&#8211;</p>

<hi rend="italic">I was pleased to receive letters from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Phelps</hi><hi rend="italic">, lately Provost of Oriel, and </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Burkitt,</hi><hi rend="italic"> acknowledging copies of the 'Bishoprick".  </hi>Also a letter very kindly expressed from old Bishop <hi rend="doubleunderline">Knox</hi>.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">John Wrightson</hi> came to lunch.  He has left Eton, &amp; is now working at this father's works. He seems to enjoy the novel experience.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi> motored me to Chilton, where I dedicated an organ in the Mission Chapel. There was a large congregation, &amp; (in spite of the Vicar's oddities of voice and manner) a reverent service. To my surprise, I was taken in to the parish room, &amp; given the 3 vols. of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Francis Thompson</hi>'s poems as a birthday present from the parish! How far this represents the Vicar's own mind, or also that of his people, I cannot know, but I am sentimental &amp; credulous today, so that I took everything at face value.</p>
         <p>Then, on returning to the Castle, I set to write acknowledgments to those who had written to me for my Birthday.  They are a curiously varied company, indicating rather personal affection than popularity, or official importance. For, indeed, I am extraordinarily alone.</p>
