         <p>A brilliant morning but much colder. The poplars in the drive still keep their leaves, but the beeches are nearly leafless.  The aspect of the country under the morning sun is gorgeous but melancholy, like a King's corpse robed in the regal splendour, but outlaid in the rigours of death.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.  Charles served, &amp; <hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>we<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> were 8 communicants.  I prayed for Hutton.  The liberty to pray for the Departed is at least one consequence of the War for which we may be thankful.</p>
         <p>I motored to Stockton, where I preached in S. James's Church at Mattins. Rather to my alarm I found that the congregation included the entire Sunday School, which, as it was the Sunday School Festival, was placed in the front part of the nave.  However the children behaved extremely well, &amp; I adapted my sermon as best I could to the double character of my audience, addressing myself first to the children and then to the grown up people, winding up with a short reference to the Sunday Schools.  Everybody was very attentive.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Ella went with me to Holmside where I preached at Evensong. The 60</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> anniversary of the consecration of the woeful little parish church was being observed, &amp; the building was crowded. Holmside has a population of 3000, and these are employed in mining.  The vicar, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">d</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"> A. R. Stobbs</hi><hi rend="italic">, has held office for 4 years.  He met me in a cassock and biretta.  From this I opined that he was an Anglo&#8211;Catholick, and this opinion was confirmed by the careful bowing to the Altar of the choir, &amp; their turning to the East at the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Gloria Patris</hi><hi rend="italic">.  If he has the wisdom to make sure that he doesn't move too fast for the congregation, he may possibly succeed in reaching the altitude of Anglo&#8211;Catholick worship: but every step upwards carries him further from the mass of the parishioners, &amp; closes the door of spiritual opportunity. It is strange, indeed, that these good men don't see that, religiously regarded, their game isn't worth the candle.  I inquired whether the pits were working and was told that one had been closed, &amp; that there was much fear that the rest would follow.  We returned to Auckland after the service.</hi>
