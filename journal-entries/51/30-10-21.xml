         <p>Ella and Fearne accompanied me to Bishop Middleham, where I officiated at the wedding of the Bishop of Goulburn (D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Radford).  He is rather a dilapidated ancient, ordained in 1892.  He cannot be less than 62 years old, and may be much older.  His bride is about half as old.  They were married from Mainsforth Hall, General Surtees himself giving the bride away, and his son–in–law acting as best man.  We lunched at Mainsforth Hall after the ceremony, and then motored to Sunderland, where I "opened" the Central Africa Exhibition, and made a speech on Foreign Missions. The Mayor presided, and there was a numerous company. After tea in the Exhibition we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>Caröe arrived in time for dinner.  He reports that the Estates Committee have again postponed their decision on the question of the Stables.  There seems some doubt as to their competence under the Measure for carrying through work of the kind projected. It might be necessary for me to incur an expenditure of, perhaps, £800, which could be raised by a loan.  I don't like the prospect of incurring charges on the income at a time when income tax &amp; surtax are mounting.</p>
