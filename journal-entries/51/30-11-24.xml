         <p>A stormy day with torrents of rain. A letter from the Vicar of Stanton informed me <hi rend="italic">that my young friend, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Jack Carr</hi><hi rend="italic">, has come to grief on the new motor&#8211;cycle, on which he was pluming himself when I saw him a few weeks ago.  He is fortunate in having come off with nothing worse than "a severely fractured arm".</hi>

         <p>I succeeded in finishing the Edinburgh sermon, which, however, is far other than I meant it to be when I started.</p>
         <p>I received from old<hi rend="doubleunderline"> Colonel Robson</hi> of West Hartlepool the volume, "<hi rend="underline">The Correspondence of Isaac Basire D.D. with a Memoir of his Life by W.R. Darnell D.D. Rector of Stanhope, 1931.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon </hi>Patterson came to see me about the dedication of a Church Army Van, &amp; stayed to tea. He is nearly 80 years old, but active and alert, worth more than most of the men who are half his age. There is a [sic] certainly a lack of stamina, a feebleness of purpose, &amp; a restlessness in the younger men of inferior social type which were absent from my contemporaries.</p>
