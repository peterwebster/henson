         <p>Rain fell at intervals, and the weather was gusty. I failed to anything effective though I wasted much time in the attempt.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Nigel Cornwall</hi> came to say good bye before leaving the diocese in order to take up his duties as chaplain to the Bishop of Colombo.  I think he is really sorry to go, and, indeed, I see no sufficient reason for his going.  I gave him a copy of S. Augustine's Confessions, and promised to send him my photograph.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">James Capron</hi> writes to tell me that, in deference to his mother's wishes, he is giving notice to his Vicar of his intention to "go south".  I cannot advise him to place an ecclesiastical claim before the obligation of piety.  But I am sorry to lose yet another hefty and serviceable young clergyman.</p>

         <p>The papers report the death of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Melchet</hi>, a monstrously wealthy Jew, head of syndicated industries with a capital of &#x00A3;95,000,000, and an enthusiastic Zionist.</p>
