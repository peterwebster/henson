         <p>The close warm weather continues: &amp; it rained heavily. I left Park Lane after breakfast, and travelled to Darlington by the Pullman express, which brought me in at 4.7 p.m.  Here Leng met me with the car.  I found, much to my surprize &amp; something to my annoyance, that Ella had left by the early train to visit cousins in the South of England.  </p>
         <p>I wrote a number of letters.</p>
         <p>I sent to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Austen Chamberlain</hi> as I promised when we talked <hi rend="strikethrough">t</hi> at Grillions, my pamphlet on "<hi rend="underline">Church &amp; State</hi>".  Also, I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Londonderry</hi>, congratulating him on his election as Chancellor of Durham University.  This circumstance ought to stimulate him to more ardent efforts to save Durham Castle.  I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Alfred Toomey</hi> at S. Augustine's Canterbury, in answer to a letter from him, which disclosed a scrupulous mind, &amp; confirmed me in my favourable impression of his character.</p>
