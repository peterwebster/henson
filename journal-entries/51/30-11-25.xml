         <p>The new volume of Bampton Lecturer handles a subject of great urgency &amp; perhaps even greater perplexity: &#8211; "<hi rend="underline">Psychology and God, a Study of the Implications of recent psychology for religious belief and practice, being the B.J. for 1930 by Rev. LW. Grestead M.A., BD. Canon theologian of Liverpool</hi>."</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Starmer</hi> (n&amp;#x00E9;e <hi rend="doubleunderline">Willink</hi>) came to lunch. She was to open the parochial sale or work.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park in the rain.</p>
         <p>I motored to Eighton Banks, &amp; there instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">Leonard Wilson</hi> to the Vicarage.  The hideous little church was crowded, the congregation being swollen by a considerable contingent from Durham.  There were many of the local clergy present.  Leonard has rather more than average ability, and ought to do well.  He has the great advantage of following a failure! I returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
         <p>Ella returned from her short visit in the South. I went to the station and met the 9.55 p.m. train by which she had travelled from Darlington.</p>
         <p>The weather had now somewhat improved, &amp; the rain has ceased.</p>
