<hi rend="bold">Saturday, December 6</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1930.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I received from <hi rend="bold">[</hi>that foxy rascal<hi rend="bold">]</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Arnold Pinchard</hi> a letter informing me that the E.C.U. are determined "to support Patrons &amp; their nominees in the vindication of their proper and legal rights" against the extra&#8211;legal catechising to which "in more than one case" the Bishop of a Diocese has subjected clergymen nominated to livings 'as a condition of institution', and asking me to use my influence with Bishops who have adopted this method of procedure so as to induce them to desist from such courses.  This, I suppose, preludes some action against <hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi>. I answered him.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">John Wrightson</hi> came to lunch, and afterwards walked round the Park with me.  He gives a rather more encouraging account of employment in his father's firm. He is very indignant over a book purporting to give an unvarnished account of Eton.  He says that "it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth", and is as unfair to the school as it is disgraceful to the Author, an Etonian who has 'gone to pieces', &amp; writes for money.</p>
