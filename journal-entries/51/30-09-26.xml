         <p>A wet, tempestuous day, and colder.</p>
         <p>The local newspaper announces the preferment of the Vicar of S. Ignatius, Sunderland, to a benefice in the Carlisle diocese.  I wrote to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Philip Strong</hi> sounding him on the possibility of returning to the diocese as Baily's successor.  [symbol] I received from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Stamfordham</hi> an inquiry about <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bell</hi>, the Vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Hilda's, Darlington, whom he meditates suggesting to the Lord Chancellor as Vicar of Stamfordham. I replied in terms of mild conventional eulogy. If Bell leaves the diocese, there will be no less than seven vacant parishes to be filled up, of which four are in my gift.</p>
         <p>Charles and I walked round the Park in the rain.</p>
         <p>[symbol] I wrote to the Bishop of Liverpool giving reasons why I was not really competent to collaborate with him in a series of small volumes intended to expound the Report of the Lambeth Conference to the laity.  I am not myself a layman: &amp; I am not sufficiently in agreement with the Report.</p>
