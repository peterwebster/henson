         <p>Charles and I cleared off the accumulated correspondence.  Then, I visited the dentist.  On my return I had an interview with the Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> William Henry Sydney Wood, a clergyman who had worked in Assam for the last 8 years, and now, mainly on account of his wife's health, desired to work in England.  He is a heavy&#8211;looking fellow, "educated" at Kelham, and <hi rend="bold underline">inconveniently deaf. How can a deaf man be adequate to the demands of a pastoral ministry?</hi>  He stayed to lunch.  I was not very encouraging, but I advised him to call on the Rector of Jarrow, on the chance that he might think him suitable for Hebburn.</p>
         <p>After lunch I motored to Darlington, and had a long conversation with the Rural Dean (Cosgrave), and the Vicar of S. Cuthbert's (Drury), on the difficult question of the use to which the money (&#x00A3;3,200) raised by the sale of the schools ought to be applied.  After tea, I returned to Auckland, arriving just as General &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Surtees were departing.  They had with them their son&#8211;in&#8211;law, Dodds.</p>
