         <p>A wet day, &amp; uncomfortably warm.  I spent the day in the Assembly, where the tiresomest discussion conceivable proceeded.  The rules of business which control the procedure of the Assembly were being revised, and this subject gave ample opportunity to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Douglas</hi> for the exercise of his distinctive gifts of obstruction.  He was incessantly on the platform, raising small points, and outlining large consequences!  In the course of the afternoon, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Robert Williams</hi> protested against this behaviour, but vainly for that kind of man is incapable of reform.    </p>
         <p>The Dean of Hereford asked me to come to Hereford in June, &amp; preach etc. at some kind of a Commemoration which the Cathedral School is organizing. I rather foolishly gave him a conditional promise.</p>
         <p>I dined in the United Universities' Club in Suffolk Street with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Philip Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</hi>. We had much pleasant talk. The rain was descending heavily when I returned to Park Lane.</p>
