         <p>The weather became much warmer during the night. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.  There were 8 communicants including Charles and William.</p>
         <p>I stayed in my study all the morning, and prepared a sermon for the Parish Festival in Christ Church, Gateshead, from the text, Hebrew X.24.5.  "<hi rend="underline">Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the system of some is, but exhorting one another; &amp; so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh</hi>."</p>
         <p>After lunch I took a solitary walk round the Park. The mildness of the air &amp; the brilliant sun suggested May rather than November, but the bareness of the trees &amp; the thick covering of dead leaves on the ground dissolved the illusion.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Leslie Wilson, William, and George Nimmins.</p>
         <p>Charles &amp; I motored to Gateshead, where I preached in Christ Church to a large congregation.  We returned to Auckland after the service, arriving at the Castle at about 9.10 p.m.</p>
