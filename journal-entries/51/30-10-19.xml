         <p>A heavy autumnal mist lay over the country when I rose.  I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8. a.m. Lady Shute and Sir William Marris communicated. Captain Capon &amp; his wife (who has now become a Papist) went off to Mass at the Papist church.  Certainly we cannot be accused of religious intolerance, however great our other faults may be.</p>

<hi rend="italic">The combination of episcopal work and the entertainment of a week&#8211;end party is not easy. Ought it to be attempted?  The right answer to that question is not easily found.  On the one hand, the week end is becoming the only time at which laymen can be brought into friendly personal contact with the Bishop, and, therefore, if he is to avoid week&#8211;end parties altogether, he will gravely restrict the area of possible intercourse with the laity.  On the other hand, not only is the efficiency of the bishop's work injured by the distraction which is inseparable from his effort to entertain his guests, but also it may well be the case that the guests themselves may take a false impression of the bishop's character and work.</hi>

         <p>We all went in to Durham for the morning service in the cathedral, when I preached in aid of the Royal Life&#8211;boat Institution.  There was a large congregation.  Pattinson and I lunched in the Deanery.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi> returned to Auckland with our guests: and, after lunch, took them to have tea with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord &amp; Lady Barnard</hi> &amp; to see Raby Castle.  Meanwhile, I preached to the School in the Chapel.  It was a pleasant &amp; moving service.  I took for my text, the verse which utters the moral of the parable of the Talents, S. Matthew xxv.29.  "<hi rend="underline">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away</hi>".  After service I had tea with the Headmaster. Three of the boys came into tea, of whom one was <hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi>.  He looks rather pallid, but is growing tall, &amp; looks intelligent.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Budworth</hi> thinks well of him, but says that he will not make a classical scholar.  I was really pleased to hear <hi rend="doubleunderline">Budworth</hi> express something like warm approval of my sermon.  After everybody else had retired he spoke to me about his own plans in confidence.  He is now 63 years old, and the time of his retirement from the Headmastership cannot be long postponed.</p>
