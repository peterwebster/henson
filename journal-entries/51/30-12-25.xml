         <p> I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. We numbered 18: the two married Brydens brought their wives, Elland, Asthton, Alexander, Leng, and John together with Harold Bryden &amp; his sister were there, and also Mrs. Smith, Irene, and Florrie The British legion band came to play carols at 9 a.m. I gave them &#x00A3;1.</p>
         <p>Charles celebrated at Eldon: &amp; we both went there for the 10.30 a.m., when he read mattins and preached, and I celebrated.  The service was hearty &amp; reverent.  The "north&#8211;end" position was rather trying, &amp; the chill and dirt of the squalid church very much so: but I was pleased with the behaviour of the communicants, &amp; noted with satisfaction a number of young men, among them.  </p>
         <p>The churchwardens are very gloomy about their new Vicar, who is to be instituted on Jan<hi rend="superscript underline">ry</hi> 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>: I could not offer them much comfort.</p>
         <p>Leaving Ella at home, we all motored to Durham, where we attended Evensong in the Cathedral, and afterwards had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow &amp; Mrs. Knight. They told us of the sudden collapse of the roof of the Bishop's Study, which might have done him to death.  </p>
