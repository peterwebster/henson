         <p>An unpleasant post.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Thurlow</hi> writes to tell me that her husband, the new Rector of Sedgefield is in a nursing home for two operations, &amp; that, on the most favourable hypothesis , he will be <hi rend="underline">hors de combat</hi> for five or six weeks.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Maish</hi> writes that he has accepted a Trust living in Halifax, &amp; will shortly leave the diocese.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">De Burton</hi> writes to say that the doctor order [sic] his wife to be transferred to the milder climate of the South of England.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning in working at the Edinburgh Sermon.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Joseph Maughan</hi>, an Ordination candidate, came to lunch. I accepted a title from S. Aidan's, West Hartlepool.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park, where the streams were in spate, &amp; everything was sodden.  Picking up an unemployed pit&#8211;lad from Coundon, named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Harry Hall</hi>, who will be 16 next March, I took him for my companion. He has 2/&#8211; weekly as a dole, &amp; picks up 5/&#8211; by caddying on the links.   He attends the unemployment centre, and is unconfirmed.</p>
