<hi>This day was spent mostly in the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaenum</orgName> where I wrote many letters </hi><hi rend="bold underline">including one to the "Times" on the proceedings at the <orgName xml:id="57">Representative Church Council</orgName></hi><hi>. I wrote also to <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>, to Ernest, to <persName xml:id="2463" display="no">Nimbus</persName>, to <persName xml:id="3571">George</persName>, and to the Baptist Phillips<persName xml:id="4484"></persName>, promising to preach in April in his chapel. Also to the <persName xml:id="3580">Vicar of Barking</persName> promising to preach on Feb. 9</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>. After lunching in the Club, I had my head shampooed. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Then I walked to Lambeth, &amp; saw the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> who was on the point of departure for Canterbury. His Grace was most cordial; thanked me warmly for what he called my publicâ€“spirited &amp; helpful behaviour at the Council: praised my speech: &amp; generally was almost gushing! He referred cryptically to the time, which will not be far distant, when I should have to view these questions from within, and be wearing "other slieves" [sic]. Is this mere hedging to make sure that, if I do go to Hereford, I shall mentally credit his Grace with the character of the author of my preferment? Or, does he know that something is really probable, &amp; was simply speaking in the light of the probability</hi><hi rend="italic">? </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Sir Lewis <persName xml:id="909">Dibdin</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> met me in the Club, &amp; said: "If I held your view, I should regard the proceedings in the Council as a considerable triumph".
