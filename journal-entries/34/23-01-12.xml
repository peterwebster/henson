         <p>A roseate sky, and a white frost. I began the day by writing to Joicey suggesting that he should offer Hunstanworth to Cobb: and sending &#x00A3;250 more to Cornish &amp; Gaymer. This makes a total of &#x00A3;1250 paid so far on account of dilapidations.</p>
         <p>I read for two hours a volume entitled "The Church in America. A study of the present condition and future prospects of American Protestantism by William Adams Brown, Ph.D. etc." (Macmillan). It is both suggestive and interesting.</p>
