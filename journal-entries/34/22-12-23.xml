         <p>I worked at a sermon for Christmas Day. After an early lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I motored to Dawdon, where we attended the formal opening of a Parish Hall and Institute. Lord Londonderry<persName xml:id="2818"></persName> performed the function very felicitously; and I made a speech which seemed to be well received. Then we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>What is the measure of responsibility which a Bishop ought to accept for clergymen who, having come into his diocese with permission to officiate, prove to be inefficient through some physical defect? They are unemployable, and destitute of means. How far have they a claim on the diocese which they have failed to serve, or on the bishop who has neither ordained nor licensed them? The scandal of their destitution will fall unquestionably on the diocese in which they have been serving at the time of their exposure: and therein principally on the bishop , who had permitted their entrance into it: But does this circumstance create claim which ought to be recognized? In the present dearth of clergy the need is so urgent, that the incumbents are ready to accept men of very dubious ability. At their instance, the bishop grants permission to officiate, then, after a few weeks, these hapless derelicts have disclosed their incompetence: and are at once unemployed and unemployable. Who is responsible?</p>
