         <p>I offered Ushaw Moor to Welby of Hunstanworth, and S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Ignatius, Sunderland, to Campbell of Hertford. Then I walked in the Park with Fawkes for more than an hour with the dogs. He went off before lunch. I presided at a Conference of C.L.B.<orgName xml:id="45"></orgName> in the large dining room. About 30 officers including half a dozen chaplains attended. Canon Cosgrave introduced the subject of the "spiritual possibilities of C.L.B., and M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Rogers from Head&#8211;quarters addressed us. After the conference we all had tea.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Carnegie Simpson</hi> has an excellent letter in the "Times" supporting my proposal for a Conference on Divorce. The danger is that, if a conference were arranged, it would be composed on the ridiculous principle of representing all the interested parties apart from the properly indispensable condition viz. that there <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a subject matter for discussion. What would be the use of "conferring" with Lacey<persName xml:id="1936"></persName>, Gore<persName xml:id="49"></persName>, Ingram, Hoskyns, &amp; all that tribe, when it is notorious that they have already &amp; in the most aggressively public way "burnt their ships" on the main issue of indissolubility? <hi rend="bold underline">For my part, I am determined not to enter into any Conference until certain preliminary assumptions are agreed upon eg. that the 'principles' disclosed in Christ's teaching are paramount &amp; unalterable, that there is a new situation undetermined either by scripture or by ecclesiastical decisions</hi>, &amp; that we are morally free to settle the practical questions.</p>
