Ellershaw with his wife &amp; son came to lunch: and were followed by the Bishop of Jarrow<persName xml:id="2785"></persName> with M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Quirk together with their Winchester son &amp; his boy. I showed them round the Castle, and they had tea. George Nimmins<persName xml:id="3571"></persName> got a lift back to Durham.</p>
