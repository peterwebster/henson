         <p>I spent the morning in trying to prepare something for the afternoon, but, of all days in the world, Good Friday is most difficult for modern preachers. I motored o West Hartlepool, and led a procession through the streets. Freddie Macdonald carried the Cross: the Mayor walked beside me, behind us were our chaplains, the Presbyterian Minister &amp; Knowlden respectively. I preached in the Town Hall, which was crowded: &amp; afterwards spoke to a congregation in Christ Church. </p>
