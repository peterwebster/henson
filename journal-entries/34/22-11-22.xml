         <p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, November 22</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1922.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fawkes</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> </hi>accompanied me to Durham, where I spend the day in diocesan engagements. On our way through Spennymoor we passed by the still burning remains of the Co&#8211;operative Stores which were destroyed last night. A considerable crowd had gathered in the street. I instituted several clergy in the Castle&#8211;Chapel, among them Francis of Middleton S. George. Then I presided over the Diocesan Conference Committee. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> joined me at lunch with J. G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>. I then attended the service in the Cathedral at which the 'Women's Offering' for the Preventive &amp; Rescue Work was presented. I preached from 1. Corinthians xiii.13. Then I had tea with Lillingston<persName xml:id="3262"></persName>, who wants me to restrain the Women Messengers from urging confession in the parishes. I undertook to consider the matter. I wound up by having an interview with that impracticable &amp; muddle&#8211;headed saint&#8211;despot Lomax<persName xml:id="5279"></persName> about his plan for dividing his parish. After talking hard for 45 minutes, I think he was as vague as ever! I was joined by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; Fawkes about 5.45 p.m. and returned to <placeName xml:id="55">Auckland Castle</placeName>. How far can I allow myself to think <hi rend="bold underline">that this day has been usefully expended</hi> <hi rend="bold">?</hi> From 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. I have certainly been "at my job" with intervals for meals, but my understanding is unfruitful, and nothing of much use has been done.</p>
