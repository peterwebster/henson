         <p>Nothing is more wanted for the regeneration of England than a vast increase of manliness, courage, and simplicity in English clergymen. These are moral qualities; but the breezes of heaven and the use of the muscles have not a little effect in cultivating them. God knows there are temptations enough in this direction as in every other; <hi rend="bold underline">but better be anything but an effeminate sneak.</hi></p>

         <p>"<hi rend="underline">An effeminate sneak</hi>" that is the description of the clergyman, as he appeared to Hort at the time of his Ordination, a type from which 'a love of outdoor occupations' was the great preservative. The letter on a 'call' to Ordination, from the post&#8211;script of which the nasty phrase is quoted, is in many respects noteworthy.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I were present in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t </hi>Anne's Church<placeName xml:id="104"></placeName> when the Burial Service was read for M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi>J.

         <p>Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I went to Hunwick, where I confirmed 30 persons. Hort was entirely against the North in the American Civil War, not because he approved of slavery, but because he held the war to be "at once entirely a war of independence, and not at all for or against slavery". I suppose it is now universally agreed that he was wrong in this estimate. He could not stand the canting &amp; spouting.</p>
