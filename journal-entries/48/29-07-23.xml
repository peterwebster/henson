         <p>I received from Edwin a letter acknowledging my cheque of terms of much gratitude. He addresses "My dear father in Christ", a form which is both unusual and disconcerting. Were he a clergyman, I should infer that he was a lawless Anglo–Catholic but, as he is a retired Navy man, I suppose it must be taken to indicate something sincere.</p>

<hi rend="bold underline">Merryweather from Pelton lunched here, &amp; discussed his parish. I counselled hin to avoid making hasty decisions before he had given himself time to learn the conditions of parochial life</hi>.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, Pears and I motored to Finchale Priory. He showed me the ruins, &amp; explained everything in an interesting manner. I was much impressed by the foreman, Wright, a fine specimen of an intelligent artisan.</p>
         <p>Sir Arthur &amp; Lady Steele–Maitland came to dine &amp; stay the night. They were on their way to Scotland. Kenneth also dined. He is painfully shy, &amp; went off rather early before we "joined the ladies".</p>
         <p>The fine weather appears to have returned &amp; brought back the menace of drought.</p>
