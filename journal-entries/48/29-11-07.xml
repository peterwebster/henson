         <p>'Hand to mouth' work cannot but be bad work, but in the present hustle I can do no other.  The morning was spent in writing letters, and preparing notes for public speeches.  </p>
         <p>At 12.30 p.m. Ella and I motored to Neasham Hall where we lunch with old Lady Wrightson.  Sir Guy &amp; his wife, and a withered little old gentleman named Samuelson with ourselves &amp; Miss Wrightson made up the party.  After lunch we proceeded to the Quaker meeting House in Darlington, where I opened an Exhibition organized by the Darlington Fine Art Society.  </p>
         <p>We returned to the Castle in time for tea.  Pattinson and I motored to Haworth where I preached in the Parish Church at a kind of Thanksgiving service for the completion of divers work in the Church.  There was a middling congregation, a large choir, a hearty service, &amp; a general sense of mutual satisfaction!  I was shown the medieval chalice &amp; paten which are the proud position of a church, which claims to have a continuous history from A.D. 680.  After service we returned to Auckland Castle, arriving at a few minutes before 10 p.m.  </p>
