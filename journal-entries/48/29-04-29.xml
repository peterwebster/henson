         <p>A very cold day. Winter is slow in going. Heaver came to lunch, and to report his engagement to a young woman in the parish. He said that his parents were contented that he should unite himself to a girl of 21 who was 'quite accomplished': but he thought it would be advisable for him to leave Crook. I recommended the vacant curacy at Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Barrow&#8211;in&#8211;Furness (Pelham) arrived in his motor about 6.30 p.m.  His chauffeur hails from Barking.  We had a good deal of talk together before turning in.  His personal connexion with the diocese of Norwich, where his grandfather reigned as Bishop for many years in those far&#8211;off days when Bishops <hi rend="underline">were</hi> Bishops in England, gives him both a keen interest in that diocese, and many opportunities of knowing what proceeds therein.  But, perhaps, the same facts tend to create a hostile prejudice in his mind when the present Bishop is concerned.  Anyway he gives an ill account of his Lordship.</p>
