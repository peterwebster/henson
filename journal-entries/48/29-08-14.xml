         <p>It is stated in this morning's papers that the death of Hugh Macnaughten has been pronounced by a coroner's jury to be due to suicide. It is deeply sad.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon we (i.e. L<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> Darling, Speed, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Darwin, Ella and I) motored to Rokeby and had tea with the Campbell&#8211;Frasers, with whom were their only son (an ungainly &amp; garrulous young man), a German princeling from Saxony, and a son&#8211;in&#8211;law of the local squire, Morritt.  We went also to the meeting of the waters, a great display of naked rock as the river was very low; and to Egglestone Priory, a small Premonstratensian House, which the Board of Works are handling with their usual efficiency.  It is most beautifully situated.  We returned to Auckland by way of Whorlton &amp; Staindrop.</p>
         <p>There came to dinner Sir Edmund &amp; Lady Chaytor, &amp; the Bishop of Gloucester with his sister &amp; niece. Professor Edward Moore, Lord Darling &amp; Di, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Cullough, with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Harold Speed &amp; ourselves made up a company of fourteen.  After dinner Di sang divinely.</p>
