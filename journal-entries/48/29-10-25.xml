<hi rend="bold">Friday, October 25</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1929.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I spent the whole morning in writing letters, &amp; after lunch went in to Durham, &amp; saw <hi rend="doubleunderline">Wallis</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cecil Ferens</hi>, and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Carter</hi>. Then I returned to Auckland, and wrote more letters.</p>
         <p>Ella had a C. M. S. meeting in the State Room, at which the orator was M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Linton</hi>, the wife of a bishop in Persia, a relatively tolerable specimen of "deputation".</p>
         <p>I am interested to see that even the <hi rend="underline">Church Family Newspaper</hi> writes severely of the letter in last Wednesday's '<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>'.</p>
         <p>The victims of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lomax</hi>'s "Catholick" zeal have appealed to me.  A certain <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Raine</hi>, who appears to be the leader of the offenders, writes to ask for an interview. He describes the '<hi rend="underline">Wesleyan Male Voice Choir</hi>" thus:&#8211;</p>
         <p>"I may state that this Choir is composed of members of all denominations &amp; is a Christian Choir to the hilt. It begins with Prayer and ends with prayer. The leader is a devout Wesleyan &amp; we practice in the Wesleyan School room every Friday night, &amp; is not, &amp; never has been used to further the Wesleyan Faith, nor in any of their services".</p>
