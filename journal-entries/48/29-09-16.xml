         <p>Roman Catholics have persecuted on <hi rend="underline">principle</hi>: Protestants have persecuted on <hi rend="underline">policy</hi>.  Both have persecuted in <hi rend="underline">panic</hi>. Toleration must be a matter principle for religious Protestants: it may be a matter of policy for Roman Catholics: it can never maintain itself against panic.</p>
         <p>W. Loxley, the Rector of Byers Green, called to announce his acceptance of Coniscliffe. He really seems delighted by the prospect of a change after 27 years at his present parish. Now I must find somebody for that.</p>
         <p>After lunch I went round to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mr [J. T. ?] Proud</hi> the coroner, to see his birds.  There are as many as 30 divers kinds – small Australian parrots &amp; all sorts of English finches – nesting &amp; bringing out their broods in complete amity.</p>
         <p>Mr. Wolson, Car&amp;#x00F6;es's <hi rend="underline">alter ego</hi> inspected the work of the ''dilapidators'', and gave Green, the contractor, the instructions for which he had been waiting.  He assured me that the Chapel ought to be restored to my use in a month's time.  I wish it were reasonably possible for me to believe him.</p>
