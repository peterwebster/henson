         </p>
         <p>There was some rain during the night, and the morning breaks with clouded skies. It is very warm, almost sultry.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were eight communicants, including John.</p>
         <p>I prepared notes for a sermon to be preached in Holy Trinity, Hartlepool, tonight.</p>
         <p>I motored to Hartlepool, and preached at Evensong.  The Church reeked of incense, which, however, was not used in the service.  The choir <hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>and congregation<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> sate during the Psalms, even during the <hi rend="underline">Gloria Patri</hi> &amp;c, a most gratuitous and unseemly innovation.  I noticed a brazen gong in the sanctuary.  As might have been expected the church was but half filled in spite of (or was in consequence of?) a huge announcement of the Bishop's preaching.  I had no notion of these Anglo&#8211;Catholick developments, but had assumed that Cobb was a reasonable Anglican.  I came away from the church much ruffled in temper &amp; got home a few minutes before 9 p.m.</p>
