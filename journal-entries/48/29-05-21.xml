         <p>Lord Rosebery is reported to be sinking. His death will doubtless be reported in the course of the day. He is 82 years old. A few days ago D<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> Kelman died.  For him Lord R. professed a very ardent admiration.</p>

         <p>I read through a volume of Pepys. The extraordinary lack of discipline in the navy, which he describes, makes it very astonishing that English fleets were able to make any fight against the Dutch. Our ships were manned by 'pressed' men: the crews were unpaid and mutinous: the captains were entirely ignorant, being 'springs of the nobility' or pets of the ladies: the victualling &amp; arming of the fleet were altogether inadequate.</p>
         <p>Pepys describe the pressing of men in London in 1666 with much sympathy. There was a genuine terror, men being afraid to appear on the streets.</p>
