         <p>There was rain during the night, but sunshine in the morning, and the day, thus brightly introduced was mild and summerlike.</p>
         <p>I wrote a number of necessary letters, &amp; then walked in the garden, &amp; talked with the gardeners, Lionel, &amp; the contractor.</p>
         <p>Pestle of Tanfield &amp; Lady Eden came to lunch. Pestle had come at his own request to lay before me a project for organizing a school for unemployed lads to be worked by Benedictine monks! It was altogether impracticable and even absurd: and I only listened with patience &amp; rejected with sympathy because the good man was plainly over–wrought &amp; enthusiastick. But I was concerned to note the crudity of his opinions, &amp; the vehemence of his expressions.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park, and had a good deal of talk with two pitmen, of whom one had been out of work for 4½ years, the other had just got into work. He showed me his pay–sheet, which showed that for 5 days work he earned no more than 30/–.</p>
