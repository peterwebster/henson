         <p>A little rain, not enough to count, fell at the beginning of the day, &amp; refreshed the world; but we must have more if the prospect of a Water famine is to be exorcized from our minds. </p>
         <p>I worked at the Liverpool Sermon, and then, after an early lunch, was motored by Lionel to Northallerton where I took part in the funeral service of Canon Brown.  There was a considerable gathering of clergy both from Durham &amp; from York, and also a crowd of parishioners.  We got back to the Castle for tea, &amp; then <hi rend="bold underline">Lionel motored me to Pelton, where I instituted Merryweather to the Vicarage</hi>. [symbol] An unpleasant incident disturbed me, &amp; led me to speak with severity of the state of the parish. A choirman handed me a hymn&#8211;book in the cover of which some abominable obscenities were written. We returned to Auckland after the service. The weather had now become very wet, so that the Richmond pageant was cancelled.   </p>
