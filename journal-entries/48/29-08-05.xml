         <p>The post brought 7 more vols. of the Loeb Library viz:&#8211;</p>
         <p>Strabo's Geography, vol. vi.</p>
         <p>Isocrates, vol. ii.</p>
         <p>Athenaeus, vol iii.</p>
         <p>Philo. Vols. i &amp; ii.</p>
         <p>Theophrastus.</p>
         <p>Cicero's Letters vol. iii.</p>
         <p>I worked at the Article, and brought it to a conclusion, buy very ineffectively. The truth is that the criticism of Boys&#8211;Smith handicaps me badly. However, I could not make any more bother about it, and sealed it up for posting to the Editor tomorrow.</p>
         <p>There was a F&amp;#x00EA;te in the Park in aid of the local Hospital. Happily the weather which was threatening in the morning improved as the day advanced, &amp; in the afternoon had become fine. A considerable number of people came into the Park.</p>
         <p>According to the closest reckoning I can make we drove over 1600 miles in the car during July.</p>
