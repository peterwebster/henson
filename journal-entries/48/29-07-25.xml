<hi rend="bold doubleunderline">S. STOREY'S MARRIAGE</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The indisposition under which I have laboured since Sunday was still heavy on body and mind when I got up to address myself to the always (for me) formidable task of a journey to London. The morning was hot, &amp; promised to be sultry.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Caröe</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel</hi> went with me to Darlington, where I took train for London.  There I went to the Temple Church and officiated at the marriage of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Samuel Storey</hi> and <hi rend="doubleunderline">Elizabeth Woodcock</hi>. There was a considerable gathering of people. After service my godson, Gilbert Simpson came to see me, bringing with him his son, Gilbert Francis, commonly called "Pip", a sharp little fellow of 9, who has been admitted as a probationer to the Temple Choir. Gilbert had tea with me, and accompanied me to King's Cross. The train was crowded with coal–owners, who had been conferring with the Government. They were in high spirits, as men relieved of heavy fear! The car met me at Darlington, &amp; I was at the Castle by 10.30 p.m.</p>
