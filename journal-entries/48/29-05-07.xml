         <p>"Free&#8211;living flat&#8211;worms" is no inapt description of the Wealthy Americans, of whom 'Dodsworth' is the type.</p>
         <p>I began writing 3 unpleasant letters:&#8211;</p>
         <p>1. To W.G. Harding refusing to accept him as a candidate for Holy Orders.</p>
         <p>2. To Coney, the Vicar of Leadgate, calling on him to resign his benefice.</p>
         <p>3. To the churchwarden of S. James's, Stockton, disallowing the vacancy in that living.</p>
         <p>Usher from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Gabriel's came to lunch.  I consented to ordain him to the priesthood at Trinity on the understanding that he took the examination afterwards.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park with the dogs.  Evans the new vicar of Etherley (a dingy looking Welshman) came to tea.  I refused permission for a layman to officiate regularly in the parish church. </p>
         <p>Tuesday, the son of the lay&#8211;reader at Quarrington, now a student at S. Chad's came to see me. </p>
