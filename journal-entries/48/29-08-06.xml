         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> announces that <hi rend="doubleunderline">Phelps</hi> has resigned the Provostship of Oriel.  I wrote to him.  This unhappy Prayer&#8211;Book controversy has alienated him from me, but nothing can cut out of my memory the recollection of his kindness, which began when for a brief space I was a lecturer at Oriel.  <hi rend="underline">When I left Oxford he wrote to me stating that he had hoped that I should have become a Fellow of Oriel</hi>. Probably, if I had stayed on in Oxford, that would have been my fortune.</p>
         <p>I walked round the Park in spite of the rain, but I got very wet.</p>
         <p>I started to read an interesting book by a Fellow &amp; Tutor of New College, Oxford:&#8211; <hi rend="underline">Europe in the XVII</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline"> century by David Ogg</hi>. It claims to be "based as far as possible on contemporary authorities, supplemented by modern monographs". "In some cases it contains information derived from sources not hitherto utilised". "For those who regard the past as a pageant, not a drama, this book is not intended." But why should one not regard the past as both a pageant &amp; a drama?</p>
