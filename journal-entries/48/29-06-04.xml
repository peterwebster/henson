         <p>The post brings me more letters from the clergy acknowledging the Charge, but not of them contains anything worth noting.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Daryngton</hi> sends a brief note, which has an appreciative ring:–</p>
         <p>'Warm thanks for your most interesting book',</p>
         <p>and the old hon. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Canon, Walker</hi> writes:–</p>
         <p>'Its characteristically lucid &amp; challenging sentences are a real treat, and spur up sharply what little power of thought one has'.</p>
         <p>Most of the clergy are careful to write before they have read so as to avoid the perilous task of venturing an opinion on their diocesan's work!  And a similar caution mars the brief acknowledgements of the Bishops, who are ever a timid race, <hi rend="underline">semper pavidi</hi>! [always quaking]</p>
         <p>I motored to Shadforth &amp; instituted the new Rector (<hi rend="doubleunderline">Tillard</hi>).</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Duchess of Athol</hi> arrived to stay the night, and receive a degree tomorrow.  She is certainly cast down at the prospect of having to give up her work at the Education Office, where she has certainly done well, &amp; brought credit to her sex.</p>
