         <p>An uncertain gusty day, threatening rain, but with bright intervals, &amp; never very bad.  We left the Castle at 9 a.m. and proceeded to Durham by way of Windlestone, picking up Lady Eden on the way. The Prince of Wales arrived at the Deanery entrance to the Cathedral very punctually, and was received by the Dean, who presented the Cathedral clergy.  Then I took him in charge, &amp; showed him quickly round the Church.  <hi rend="bold underline">As we entered the Galilee I stumbled, &amp; went 'spread&#8211;eagle'. This was undignified &amp; humiliating, but not happily serious</hi>. H.R.H. was fidgety &amp; uninterested, and I was not so satisfied with him as I had expected to be. The thing that interested him most was the War Memorial! I parted from him at the North Entrance. He went on to the Castle: and Ella &amp; I went to Newcastle, where we called at Benwell Tower, and went with the Bishop of Newcastle to the Exhibition. Here we lunched &amp; witnessed the formal opening by the Prince. There was a strong wind &amp; an immense crowd.</p>
