         <p>The hot close weather continues. I finished the letter for the next "Bishoprick", &amp; I dislike it more everytime I look at it!</p>
         <p>After lunch Lady Eden, Ella, the Swiss lady, Fearne, &amp; I went to the Waterworks and were there received by M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Proud, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Councillor Young, &amp; others.  They showed me the machinery by which water is collected, filtered and distributed to Bishop Auckland.  The supply of water which percolates through the gravel is limitless, &amp; considerable supplies of water have been sold to more necessitous districts in the County.  We were shown the flower&#8211;beds, which make a brave show, &amp; the houses where the stone is manufactured for the necessary buildings.  Altogether the spectacle was surprising, &amp; interested me greatly.  Then we motored via Stanhope to Hunstanworth, where we had tea with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi>Nairne Clark. We returned through Blanchland, which we stopped to see. A stout churchwarden, archaeologically&#8211;minded, who is the agent of the Crewe Trust, showed me much oleaginous deference.</p>
