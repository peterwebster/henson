         <p>A wet day. I left Londonderry House in good time to catch the train leaving King's Cross at 11.40 a.m., which arrived at Darlington about 10 minutes after time, 5.6 p.m.</p>
         <p>At Grantham a young man <hi rend="italic">came into my carriage, and we got into conversation.  His name was </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Walter de Leney (a variant of the Irish Delaney)</hi><hi rend="italic"> and he lodges at Norton.  He is one of the chemists employed at the Synthetic Works, and is aged 27.  We grew to be confidential, and I learned that he was unconfirmed but not irreligious.  He had been unwilling to be confirmed at Dulwich School, but seemed disposed to consider the question now.  We parted with professions of friendship.  At </hi>Darlington Leng met me with the car. On arriving at the Castle, I proceeded to deal with the correspondence which was left over from yesterday. There was little of interest.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Lang in the course of his speech referred to Venice, and quoted Wordsworth's well&#8211;known sonnet. Lord Darling scribbled on a menu&#8211;card and passed to me the following lines:&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">When Venice took unto herself a mate</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">She did espouse an everlasting See,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Not Canksbury', No. He keeps his State</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Untroubled by the all&#8211;pervading She.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">This, perhaps, is below Darling's form.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The author sent me "The Celtic Church in England After the Synod of Whitby' by John L. Gough Meissner M.A". I read it through in the train, and found it interesting and informing beyond my expectations.</p>
         <p>Lillingston informs me that M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Harold Speed had been commissioned to paint my portrait, &amp; requests me to write to him with respect to it. This I did suggesting that, if he thought well, he might come here and study my interesting countenance in familiar surroundings! The sitting&#8211;business is a horrid nuisance.</p>
