<hi rend="doubleunderline">Leonard Wilson</hi> went away after breakfast.  Before he left, I asked whether he would object to my repeating to the Archbishop what he told me about Leatherhead last night.  He was a boy there 20 years ago, &amp; things may have improved since, but the same Headmaster is in command.  I gave him a copy of '<hi rend="underline">Spiritual Healing</hi>'.</p>
         <p>Later, I discussed with the Bishop of Jarrow the substance of his statements, &amp; he agreed that I ought to seize an opportunity of informing the Archbishop.</p>

<hi rend="italic">After lunch I motored to Durham, and presided at the meeting of the Board of Training and Maintenance. It was apparent to me that the control of diocesan affairs is tending to pass out of my hands into those of my Suffragan. I do not know that this would matter, if the discipline of the diocese could be secured; but his seems to me doubtful. I think I must try to arrange a regular meeting with both the Archdeacons, &amp; thus keep a more continuous control on the business of the diocese as a whole.</hi>
