         <p>A stormy day with rain at intervals.  I found myself in a strangely restless mood, so that my attempt to write a sermon for the troops came to nothing.  An Ordination candidate name Slater came to lunch.  I counselled him to seek a tithe in Crook, &amp; to write forthwith to the Vicar.  In the afternoon I walked round the Park.  <hi rend="underline">Voila tout</hi>!</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I asked </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Neville Chamberlain</hi><hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="4164"></persName> whether he thought the youth, who were passing out of the secondary schools, showed any disposition to join the Unionist party, and he replied with a reluctant but decided negative.  He doubted whether the Unionist dominance could ever be restored in Birmingham &amp; the district round.  He said that he observed a tendency on the part of the male voters to back out of politics, &amp; leave everything to the females.  The latter, he judged, were at the mercy of the last speaker.  He was opposed to the extension of the franchise to women but doubted whether there had been any real chance of averting the blunder.</hi>
