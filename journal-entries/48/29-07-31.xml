         <p>The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Thurlows</hi> went off in the course of the morning.  There was a considerable downpour of rain when they started on their motoring course to Scotland.</p>
         <p>I continued work on the Article.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I walked round the Park with <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> McCullagh</hi>, &amp; on my return had an interview with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi>. The youngster was more satisfactory than before, &amp; restored me to some measure of confidence. He does seem to be anxious to try his fate with this History scholarship, and, if he fails as he almost certainly will, the attempt will steady him. I set him a "General Paper" to test his knowledge &amp; power of expression.</p>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Mr. Basil Brooke Foss Westcott</hi>, a grandson of my predecessor, came to see me with a view to Ordination. He is a heavy looking youth of 22, but his testimonials are good, and a year at Westcott House may widen his mind and discipline his life.</p>
