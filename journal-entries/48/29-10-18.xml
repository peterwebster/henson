         <p>It was raining when we went to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Anne's for the celebration, but it soon cleared, and by 11 a.m. it was a fine day. </p>
         <p>After the celebration we had breakfast, &amp; then from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. we were in conference.  <hi rend="bold underline">I announced my intention of visiting the Rural Deaneries in order to address the Parochial Church Councillors on the present situation in Church &amp; State, &amp; though none of them welcome, &amp; some of them detest, the prospect of</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I walked round the park.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sumner</hi> came to ask my advice as to accepting a living in the Newcastle diocese, which had been offered to him.  I advised him to take it.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Blackwall</hi> came to say 'Goodbye' on leaving the diocese in order to take up his work as Vicar of Northallerton.</p>
         <p>I drafted resolutions on Sunday Observance for Rawlinson to move at the Diocesan Conference, &amp; sent them to Carter.</p>
