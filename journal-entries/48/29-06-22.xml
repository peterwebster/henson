<hi rend="italic">I received from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Romer</hi><hi rend="italic"> the proof of an article.

<hi rend="italic">At tea&#8211;time, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Mr Harold Speed </hi><hi rend="italic">made his appearance. We went over the house together in order to choose a room in which he might work, but none pleased him save the State&#8211;room itself, and he informed me that he likes to smoke as he worked!! What will Ella say to that? He is a tee&#8211;totaller, &amp; breakfasts off coffee &amp; fruit. He talks incessantly, and perhaps the personal pronoun is over&#8211;worked but he is always interesting &amp; suggestive! His opinions are expressed with a freedom, which suggests some lack of good breeding, &amp; he volunteered the information that he 'had no education'. So there we are.</hi>
