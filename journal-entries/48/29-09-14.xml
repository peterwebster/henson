         <p>I spend the morning in reviving the letter for the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishoprick</hi>, which I sent to the Bishop of Jarrow, asking him whether he thought that it might be published in a pamphlet.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I walked round the Park and had talk about Religion.</p>
         <p>The Papists are holding a "<hi rend="underline">National Catholic Congress &amp; Centenary Catholic Emancipation celebration</hi>" in the Caxton Hall, Westminster: and according to the newspaper reports, they are in an arrogant, not to say braggart mood.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Cardinal Bourne</hi>, with some astuteness, seizes the opportunity provided by Anglican confusion &amp; presents the Roman Church as the only trustworthy exponent of Christian morality, &amp; the only adequate champion of Christian Faith. Modernism &amp; "Compassionate Marriage" are just now being forced on the public notice with much crudity &amp; insistence. This woeful Prayer Book Controversy has exhibited the Church of England as the patient slave of a secularized State, &amp; internally as a menagerie rather than a family.</p>
