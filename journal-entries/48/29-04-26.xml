         <p>We left the Hotel Palais D'Orsay at 7.45 a.m., &amp; motored to the Gare du Nord, where we took the 8.25 a.m. train for Boulogne.  <hi rend="bold underline">There we got on the steamer for Folkstone. The ship was densely crowded with passengers from India. Among them was Sir John Simon</hi>, with whom we had some pleasant conversation.  The steamer arrived half an hour after time; and there was a horrible crush at Victoria.  <hi rend="bold underline">It emerged afterwards that one cause of delay &amp; confusion was the precautions taken by the police to protect Simon &amp; those that were with him from molestation by Indian students who had organised a demonstration against them</hi>. We caught the train at King's Cross, &amp; travelled comfortably to Darlington, where we were met by Lionel with the car. The Castle was smelling horribly of fresh paint, &amp; looking vulgarly smart!</p>
