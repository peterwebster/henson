         <p>Lord Chelmsford &amp; Miss Headlam went off by the early train. Lang motored them to Darlington.</p>
         <p>I completed the Liverpool sermon, and then had an interview with Parry&#8211;Evans.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon Lionel &amp; I motored to Hart where I consecrated an addition to the churchyard, &amp; gave an address.</p>
         <p>On returning to the Castle, I wrote to Cobb, Vicar of Holy Trinity, Hartlepool, offering him the little living of Coniscliffe.</p>
         <p>I made an effort, &amp; finished an article on '<hi rend="underline">The word Protestant, 1529&#8211;1929</hi>' for the Bishoprick, &amp; Fearne made a copy of the Liverpool Sermon. These, together with the address at the Chancellor's Installation, will suffice for my contribution to the Bishoprick. I sent them to Carter.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Copemann, M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Cruickshank, and two monstrously plain girls named Alcock, nieces of Mary Retford, arrived on a visit.  Great graces of the spirit are required to outweigh such defects of its carnal frame!  The weather was quite chilly.</p>
