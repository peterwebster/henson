         </p>
         <p>About 35 clergy attended the function in the State Room at 4 p.m. when I presented in the name of the donors gifts to Lionel (α) from the clergy, and (β) from the household. Parry Evans, who had organized everything, made a speech, and then Patterson and Stephenson "said a few words". Then I made a short speech, and presented the gifts. Lionel made a brief &amp; happily expressed reply, and the little function came to an end.</p>
         <p>A considerable number of persons came to play tennis including Lag Söderblom, Peter Richardson "the Russian Prince", Ken, and young Dawson–Walker.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Boys–Smith has a letter in the <hi rend="underline">Spectator</hi> headed '<hi rend="underline">The Revised Prayer Book and the Bishops'</hi>. It is effective because it ignores all the really important factors in the practical problem. The counsel which he is good enough to offer the Bishops is quite impracticable. It is, indeed only the old familiar demand that they should enforce the existing law.</p>
