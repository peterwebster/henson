         <p>Car√∂e secured from me a very reluctant consent to the removal of the ivy from the wall at the East end of the chapel.</p>
         <p>Ella and I motored to Durham, where I presided over the annual meeting of the Preventive and Rescue Association.  In the afternoon I walked in the Park, &amp; there lighted on four youths from Tow Law, who are attending the training centre for unemployed in Bishop Auckland.  I took them into the garden, &amp; showed them the photographs of wild beasts which I had cut out of the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>. They were keenly interested.</p>
         <p>Ella and I motored to Newcastle, where I attended a meeting of the Castle Preservation Committee: Sir Thomas Oliver intrigued us with a talk of a contribution of &#x00A3;10,000, which he seemed surprised had not been paid in. We have been so often deluded that we dare not permit ourselves to be optimistic.</p>
         <p>I undertook to write something on Disestablishment for "The review of the Churches," &amp; I paid the month's household bills.</p>
