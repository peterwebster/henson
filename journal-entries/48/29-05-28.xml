         <p>I got away from Edinburgh by the 7.40 a.m. train, and had breakfast on board.  Leng met me with the car at Newcastle, &amp; brought me to the Castle at 11.20 a.m.  <hi rend="i doubleunderline">Archbishop S&amp;#x00F6;derblom</hi><hi rend="italic"> arrived last night with his daughter </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Yvonne</hi><hi rend="italic">. He looks older &amp; frailer, but he is my junior by two years. In the afternoon Ella took our guests to Rokeby to have tea with the Campbell Frasers; and I remained in my study, and cleared off my correspondence.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">After dinned I had much conversation with the Archbishop. He is full&#8211;filled with the magniloquent &amp; meaningless phrases which are current in episcopal circles in England, and which impose wonderfully on foreigners. I am rather embarrassed by the knowledge that almost all the "causes" to which S</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">&amp;#x00F6;</hi><hi rend="italic">derblom devotes his superabundant energies are distasteful to me. For instance, he is an enthusiast for "Copec", and I hold "Copec" in contempt. He exults in cosmopolitan conferences &amp; congresses; I look on them as among the least satisfactory features of our time.</hi>
