         <p>I read through, (but rather hastily for there is much "padding" in the book) Macdonald's biography "<hi rend="underline">Bishop Stirling of the Falklands</hi>". He was the senior bishop at the Lambeth Conference of 1920, but I retain no recollection of him whatsoever.</p>
         <p>We all (i.e. Ella, Fearne, Miss Headlam, Pattinson and I) motored to Durham, and attended the morning service in the Cathedral, where I preached the "University" sermon to a considerable congregation. My text was 1. Samuel iii.1. "The word of the Lord was precious in those days: there was no open vision." The attention was close and sustained. I took about 25 minutes in delivery. We all lunched at the Deanery. Then I had some talk with the Bishop of Jarrow: after this I went to Bow Church, and preached to about 70 students of both sexes, members of the D.I.C.C.U. a branch of the Student Christian Union. The ladies, who had attended Evensong in the Cathedral, rejoined us, &amp; we motored to Auckland Castle for tea.</p>
