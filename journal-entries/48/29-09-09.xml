         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> records the death of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir James W. Headlam&#8211;Morley </hi>the Bishop of Gloucester's brother. I sent his brother a letter of condolence.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Simpinkson</hi>, the late Vicar of Blaydon, came to see me, and stayed to lunch. I pointed out to him the strangely unsuitable character of the letter, which he had printed in his parish magazine as a farewell to his parishioners, &amp; I think he saw the justice of my words. He said that he had tried to supplement it in his sermon last night. He is not a bad fellow, but cranky.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Cecil McCullagh</hi> called to tell me about Kenneth, whom he had seen last night.  He thinks that he ought to go back to Oxford for next term: &amp; undertook to give him a straight talking to!</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">W. John William Crosies</hi>, a wall&#8211;eyed tobacconist from Felling, who is an organist &amp; choirmaster at the Church of the Venerable Bede, came to see me. He aspires to be ordained, &amp; will pay for his training. I did not dislike him, &amp; referred him to the Bishop of Jarrow.</p>
