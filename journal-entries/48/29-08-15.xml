         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Darwin left this morning.  Lag went off yesterday.  Peter Richardson and Enis Howe came for a short visit.  They hope to be married in February.</p>
         <p>John was clothed with my robes, &amp; sate to the painter, leaving me free to make a start with a sermon for Shildon.</p>
         <p>After his day's work was ended I took my Painter for an hour's run in the motor ending with a call at Windlestone where Sybil, Lady Eden, showed him the late Sir William Eden's sketches.</p>
         <p>Professor Edward Moore developed a chill, and retired to bed. The doctor was sent for.</p>

He certainly cannot provide it himself.</p>
