         <p>I finished Ogg's Europe in the XVII<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Century.  My knowledge is too inadequate to justify either criticism or approbation, but it is mere matter of fact that I found this book interesting and informing in no common degree, &amp; that I read it with much pleasure.</p>
         <p>After lunch I motored to west Hartlepool, and found Canon Knowdlen in a bad way.  He is unable to hold a book, &amp; quite obviously unable to do any work.  <hi rend="bold underline">I suggested that he should resign, but the notion of resignation was plainly repugnant to him. He began to weep, &amp; I felt like a Bashi–Bazouk discovered in the act of seething a kid in its mother's milk, or some other equally atrocious inequity!</hi>  I went on to Aycliff, where I had tea with Canon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Patterson.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lag Söderblom</hi> arrived on a week's visit.  Jack Clayton arrived on a two days' visit.  He seems to be in good health, happily conscious that he is affectionately regarded by a large &amp; growing body of friends, and looking forward with confidence to his new work in Bristol.</p>
