         <p>Old Canon Jones came to see me about his resignation. He has been nearly 45 years at Winlaton, which has now a parish of 16,500 people. He will not resign unless he can be assured of at least &#x00A3;200 per annum as a pension. I promised to try to secure this. In the course of our discussion I called his attention to the fact that the Diocesan calendar states the number of parochial church Electors in Winlaton to be no more than 130. He did not seem either surprised or scandalized by the number though he 'thought there must be more than that'!</p>
         <p>Archdeacon Rawlinson &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Burrill came to lunch. When they had gone, Lionel &amp; I took a turn round the Park.</p>
         <p>I had interviews 1. With an Ordination candidate from Deaf Hill named Carter: and 2. With a Canadian clergymen names Neale, who desires to come into this diocese.</p>
         <p>I motored to Evenwood, &amp; confirmed 45 persons, of whom no more than 9 were males! Car√∂e &amp; Alban arrived.</p>
