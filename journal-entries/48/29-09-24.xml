         <p>The weather became very warm.  I worked at a sermon for Sunderland, and after lunch walked round the Park with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jimmie Dobbie</hi>. I received 'with the author's compliments' a small volume, which seems interesting: '<hi rend="underline">Thomas Chalmers, Apostle of Union</hi>' by <hi rend="underline">Adam Philip. D. D.</hi> (James Clarke &amp; C<hi rend="superscript underline">o</hi>). Breakfast was D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Chalmers' favourite meal.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Scott</hi>, like <hi rend="doubleunderline">Johnson</hi>, indulged in a very hearty breakfast, &amp; lamented as life went on <hi rend="italic underline">that he could only take three eggs</hi><hi rend="italic">. (p. 71.)</hi>  
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Chalmers</hi> had a favourite idea that when a man reached sixty he entered on the Sabbath of life. (p. 65).  He lived to be 67.  At the Disruption he was 63, so that the historic achievement of his life was effected after 60.</p>
         <p>Among the 'memorable sayings' is the familiar tag, '<hi rend="underline">A house&#8211;going minister makes a church&#8211;going people</hi>'. I wonder whether this was original. Probably the great man was only quoting it. But even so, he may have made it 'current coin'.</p>
