         <p>A sultry day with occasional showers, &amp; thunder in the afternoon.  I laboured with little effect on the article for Lunn's Review.  Ella &amp; I walked round the Park, &amp; were caught in a thunderstorm.  But we heard the cuckoo!  </p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Dunston, where I dedicated a part of the temporary church, which will, when completed, serve as a school &amp;c: the permanent church being erected on the adjacent ground. The Architect (Potts) and the contractors presented me with a silver dish! We dined with Colonel and M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Thompson at Whickham.  They are lamentably vocal about their parson.  Against sheer incapacity, innocent because inherent, all ecclesiastical systems are helpless.  â€“ We got home by 11.15 p.m.: and I handed over the "bowl" to Ella, who was glad of it.</p>
