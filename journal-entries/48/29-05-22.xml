         <p>Knight of Ryhope, writing to thank me for help on Sunday, takes occasion to press on me the merits of J.: and I thought it well to 'bell the cat' by writing directly to J. and advising him to seek a curacy in another diocese, where he c<hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi> earn for himself a standing, &amp; not compel me to communicate his record.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Jarrow write to say that the Dean &amp; Chapter have nominated Cecil Booth the Curate in Charge of Cleadon Park, to the Vicarage of Holy Trinity, South Shields, vacant by the sudden death of the Rev<hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi> A. R. Stiggall.</p>
