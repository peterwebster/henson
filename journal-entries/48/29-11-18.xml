<hi rend="bold">Monday, November 18</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1929.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I received from <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mary Radford</hi> very disconcerting tidings about <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi>. She offered to talk to him; and I at once wrote to accept her offer. It looks as if I made a mistake in enabling that boy to get to Oxford.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Prof: <hi rend="doubleunderline">Watson</hi> at Oxford in answer to his letter, &amp; thanking him for a report of his Cambridge sermon on Methodism.</p>
         <p>Then I revised my Notes for the Rural Deaneries.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> and I walked round the Park, picking up <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">c</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cullagh</hi> on the way.</p>
         <p>We motored to Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees, where I admitted the new Vicar to the perpetual curacy of S<hi rend="superscript">t </hi>James, from which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Jones</hi> retired after 23 years tenure of the benefice.  The new man is a youngish looking man about 40 years of age, married, with 2 small children.  His name is <hi rend="doubleunderline">Wood</hi>, and he hails from the south. There was a good muster of the local clergy, but the congregation was smaller than I had expected. The weather, going and returning, was wet &amp; boisterous.</p>
