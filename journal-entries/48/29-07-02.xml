         <p>The <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d.</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Harold Hawkins</hi>, aged 25, and unmarried, came to see me. He has only been 2 years in Orders, is now an assistant curacy at S. Luke's, Maidenhead came to see me. He desires to become assistant curate of Brandon, in order that he may keep terms in Durham University. He is an amiable and well–mannered youth, but rather weak in appearance. He comes from Exeter where his father is principal "cutter" of the well–known ecclesiastical tailors, Whippell and Co. I was kind to him, and gave him lunch.</p>
         <p>Ella went with me to Durham, where I repeated the performance of yesterday, preaching to another Cathedral–full of Mothers the same sermon as served me then. It was a notable and heartening spectacle. There cannot have been much fewer than 6000 mothers in the two congregations. After service we had tea with Canon &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Dawson Walker, &amp; then returned to Auckland, stopping on the way to see the Archbishop's son, Lag Söderblom, a good looking Swedish lad who is 'learning English' at Croxdale Vicarage.</p>
