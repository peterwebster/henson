         <p>Lionel came with me to Darlington where I took the early train to King's Cross. After leaving my bag at Londonderry House, I went to the Royal Academy and looked at the Pictures. There was nobody else there so that I could see everything to great advantage. Then I walked to the Athenaeum and had tea. Lord Crauford was there, and we had some talk. He is very confident that our national Gallery is superior to the Louvre, especially in arrangement. Peers also was there, and Fleming.</p>
         <p>I dined with the President &amp; Academy. The company included a good many acquaintances, &amp; my neighbours at table included Lords Darling, Shaw, &amp; Northbourne. Archbishop Lang made a good speech &amp; seemed full of vigour. His predecessor, Lord Davidson, was in the company.</p>
