         <p>Our guests went off after breakfast. Then I wasted the whole morning over those hateful Income Tax papers, which are as inexplicable to me as ever in spite of Dashwood's assistance.</p>
         <p>Latimer, the Ordination Candidate from Whickham, who has been at Salisbury Theological College, came to lunch, and afterwards walked with me in the Park.</p>

(v. <hi rend="underline">Letters on Church &amp; Religion selected and arranged by D.C. Lathbury ii. 3</hi>.)</p>
         <p>"It is this false and hollow system of religion hating all that have disturbed its leaden slumbers, which now unites itself with an honest &amp; vehement fanaticism to raise a cry of 'No Popery', and under that cry denounces the genuine spirit of the Church of England."</p>
