         <p>The day was wet at first, but grew to be fine, and in the afternoon lawn&#8211;tennis was played on the bowling&#8211;green.  Among the visitors was <hi rend="doubleunderline">Xan Wynne&#8211;Willson</hi>.  At his father's request, I took occasion to talk to him about his future career.  He will take his degree at Cambridge next year, when he will be 22.  I suggested Ordination, &amp; he promised to think over it.  Mr. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Priestman</hi> asked to see me about his parish.  It was, of course, the usual story â€“ incompetent vicar, empty church, &amp;c.  But what can I do?  <hi rend="bold underline">The afternoon post brought me </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">1. A resolution from "a great public meeting held in Pelton Co&#8211;operative Hall numbering some 700 people" to protest against </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">Merryweather</hi><hi rend="bold underline">'s Romanizing proceedings.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>2. A complaint by a certain <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mr. Todd</hi>, who is apparently some kind of lay&#8211;worker, in Sunnyside, that he has been summarily and unjustly dismissed by his Vicar, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Tindal</hi>, the Vicar of Stanley.</p>
         <p>3. A painful letter from Kenneth explaining that he could not come to M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Henson's party on the score of ill&#8211;health.</p>
