         <p>I spent the whole morning in writing a sermon for the Durham students.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, I first saw the contractor in the chapel, where he was busily engaged in superintending the removal of the scaffolding. Then I walked in the Park. In the Counden Beck, a filthy stream, I heard voices, which, when I went to see, I found to proceed from a party of rather rough lads engaged in some kind of mischief under the little bridge. I called them out, &amp; then they insisted on accompanying me back to the castle! I found it difficult to understand their dialect: but they struck me as a quite good material in the process of being permanently damaged by unemployment. Their ages varied from 14 to 17: they had all left school, &amp; had no other work than acting as caddies to golfers.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> went with me to Byers Green where I collated <hi rend="doubleunderline">Blackett</hi> to the Rectory vacated by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Loxley</hi> by his preferment to Coniscliffe.  The little church was crowded with parishioners, &amp; everybody seemed to be in good humour.</p>
