         </p>
         <p>A bright warm morning, &amp; the country slightly veiled in a bright haze, prophesying heat.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the chapel at 7.45 a.m. We numbered 19 comm<hi rend="bold superscript underline">ts</hi>, viz: 19 males &amp; 9 females. At 9.20 a.m. I left the Castle &amp; motored to Ryhope, where I preached &amp; celebrated. There was a fair congregation, which included an unusual number of youths &amp; young men, as well as a body of scouts. There were only 43 comm<hi rend="bold superscript underline">ts</hi>, most having received the Sacrament at the earlier services. Afterwards I went back to Auckland Castle.</p>
         <p>We all motored into Durham, &amp; attended Evensong in the Cathedral. I occupied the Throne, &amp; pronounced the Benediction. We had tea with the Dean, who affably showed us over the Deanery. Then we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>The beautiful warm weather was ideal for the holiday&#8211;makers, who were everywhere in evidence. Motor&#8211;cycles, those pests of the road, abounded.</p>
