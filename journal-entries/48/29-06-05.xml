         <p>We all motored to Durham for the Installation of the Duke of Northumberland as Chancellor of the University. The ceremony took place in the Castle yard, and was successfully organized by the indefatigable Moulsdale. Sir Thomas Oliver as Vice–Chancellor presided, and I sate beside him. After the Installation we all went to the Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving. I preached shortly from Psalm 57.i "<hi rend="underline">Her foundations are upon the holy hills</hi>'.  I began by recalling the fact that 16 years ago I had preached at the Installation of the late Duke of Northumberland.  After service, we all went to Hatfield Hall, where <hi rend="strikethrough">I</hi> we lunched.  I sate between the Duchess of Atholl, &amp; Lady Smith, the wife of Sir <hi rend="doubleunderline">George Adam Smith</hi>, who received a degree.  Lunch was followed by a Garden Party in the Fellows' Garden, from which I came away to attend to the Confirmation Service in the Cathedral at 4.15 p.m.  There were less than 100 candidates, <hi rend="bold">[123]</hi> less than half of the usual number.  Among them was <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kitty Wilson </hi>from Burnopfield. After the Confirmation I had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow and M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Knight with whom were Sir George and Lady Smith.  Then we returned to Auckland.</p>
         <p>I had a good deal of talk with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Duke of Northumberland</hi>, who impressed me well. He is evidently a man of ability, good sense, and good feeling. It is a pity that he has taken up so extreme an attitude in the region of politics, for the fact hinders his acceptance by the people. He told me that he had read through my book on '<hi rend="underline">Disestablishment</hi>', which the publishers had sent to him with my compliments. He is obviously impressed, but, of course, unconverted. It would be too much to expect a 'Die–hard' Tory, who is also the Proprietor of the '<hi rend="underline">Morning Post</hi>' to allow the propriety of disestablishment in any circumstances. It is difficult to make people see that a comparatively small incident may raise a very large issue, and lead to far–reaching consequences.</p>
