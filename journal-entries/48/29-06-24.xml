         </p>
         <p>A beautiful morning portending another hot day.</p>
         <p>The clergy arrived to the number of about fifty. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the chapel at 11.30 a.m. and afterwards we all lunched together. During the afternoon they played games, &amp; walked up: then had tea: attended Evensong in the Chapel and dispersed. I spoke shortly to them, expressing my approval of the Trinity Society, which they had formed last year, and speaking briefly about the prospect of Disestablishment. I had some speech with Carr, Dobson, and Dobbie (who had succeeded in passing his examination for B.A.). To Capron I gave a copy of 'Notes on Spiritual Healing'. I was much perturbed by the necessity of sitting to W. Speed, who took possession of the State room, and exhibited a most masterful disposition, so that I had not a rabbit's courage to withstand him. Ella and Fearne returned from Scotland during the afternoon.</p>
