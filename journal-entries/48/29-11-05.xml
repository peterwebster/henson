<hi rend="bold">Tuesday, November 5</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1929.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A boisterous day, and heavily raining at nightfall.</p>
         <p>An Ordination candidate from Mirfield, named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fausset</hi>, came to see me, &amp; stayed to lunch.  He was a friend of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gilbert Harding</hi>, another Mirfield student, who has become a Papist, &amp; is "in the seventh heaven "of neophytical delight!</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Hector Bamlett</hi> and his wife also came to lunch.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Ella</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cecil Ferens</hi>, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattison </hi>and I motored to Coniscliffe, where I "collated" the Rev. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Francis Edwin Loxley</hi> to the Vicarage.  He is no less than 71 years old, but the parish is small one.  In spite of the rain there was a considerable congregation.  M<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Loxley</hi> has relations in the district, &amp; there was evidently a muster of the "gentry".  And the clergy were also well represented.  The church is ancient, 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century, but it was apparently burned in 1843, so that the roof is modern.  We returned to Auckland after the service, depositing Cecil in the marketplace in time to catch the 'bus'.</p>
