<hi rend="bold">Friday, October 11</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1929.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The weather became warmer during the night. The day started finely. As I shaved I looked down on Elland watering his newly planted wall&#8211;flowers in the bed below.</p>
         <p>I motored to Newcastle, and presided over the special meeting of the Governors of Barnard Castle School.  There was a full attendance.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Hodgson</hi> was very rude to me but I ignored him: &amp; finally we got through without disaster, &amp; lunched.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I returned to Auckland Castle, and then had an interview with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi><hi rend="italic">.  He has been in </hi>London for the last 3 weeks, but what he has been doing does not appear. I talked to him very earnestly; told him that I would not continue my help to him after next summer, when he ought to take his degree. He professed good intentions, but I no longer have any confidence in him.</p>
         <p>I finished reading <hi rend="doubleunderline">Shane Leslie</hi>'s new novel, 'The Anglo&#8211;Catholick', &amp; and found it tiresome, incoherent, and unconvincing.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi> came back with my cheque, which I had stupidly dated 'November' instead of October.  So we had some more talk, &amp; said prayers together.</p>
