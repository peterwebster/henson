         <p>Lionel went away by the early train. Before he left, he gave me his photograph, and so vanished from my world, in which he has played no unimportant part for nearly 4 years.</p>
         <p>We motored to Durham, where I showed Mr. Chamberlain &amp; his daughter over the Cathedral. He exhibited a gratifying keenness of interest &amp; historical appreciation. Then we went to the Castle, where the Master (Ellershaw) acted as guide. We lunched in the Common Room, being joined there by Mrs. Ellershaw &amp; Cecil Ferens. Then we took them to the Station, &amp; ourselves returned to Auckland, where a numerous company, mostly females, came to Ella's weekly reception. Later, Lillingston and his son Charlie came to see us, &amp; I had much talk with them both.</p>
