         <p>I finished the Thanksgiving sermon. After lunch Lionel motored me to Durham where I preached to a great concourse of the Mothers' Union. They filled the Cathedral. I don't suppose that more than a fraction of them heard my Sermon. I returned to Auckland after the service. Ella had arrived from London in my absence.</p>
         <p>[symbol]<hi rend="italic"> After dinner Ella and I motored to Catterick and attended an 'At Home' given by the Colonel and Officers of the Royal Engineers.  Sir Bindon Blood presided.  I had some talk with him at supper.  He said that he had spent 20 years in India, that he spoke the Indian language as easily as his own, that he taught the policy of making Delhi the Capital sound if we kept sufficient white troops in India to hold the country, that the troops now in India were insufficient for that purpose, that the present essay in autonomy could not possibly succeed, that 'Mother India' gave a true description but pictured the horrible facts as more widely representative of Indian life than they actually were.  We returned to the Castle about midnight.</hi>

         <p>'The Cathedral Church is the Parish Church of the whole Diocese (which Diocese was therefore commonly called Parochia, in ancient times, till the application of this Name to the lesser Branches into which it was divided, made it, for distinction's sake, to be called only by the name of Diocese) and it hath been affirmed, with great probability, that if one resort to the Cathedral Church, to hear Divine Service, it is a resorting to the Parish Church, within the natural sense and meaning of the statute.'</p>
         <p>Accordingly 35 Con. II, where the Ecclesiastical Court w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> not admit the plea of having rec<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> the Sacrament in the Cathedral of Bristol, the Court of King's Bench awarded a prohibition.</p>
