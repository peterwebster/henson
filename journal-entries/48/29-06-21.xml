         <p>I packed my bags, and came away from Park Lane after breakfast.  I was first to the Club, where I read the papers.  The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> prints the letter which I wrote yesterday.  I travelled to Darlington by the Pullman express, leaving at 11.15 a.m., and arriving at 4.7 p.m.  Lionel met me with the car.</p>
         <p>We went through what correspondence as had accrued. There was little of interest.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The Record has rather an ill&#8211;natured article headed "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Apologia pro sua retractatione</hi><hi rend="italic">". It is good enough to allow that I am sincere, and it says that I am "possessed of gifts that are the envy of my contemporaries", but it rejects my apology as unconvincing, and persists in regarding me as a "weather&#8211;cock". I didn't expect anything generous from this quarter, but I did expect something more intelligent &amp; discriminating.</hi>

         <p>The old Archbishop of Armagh writes dissentiently, but in a kindly tone. He has, of course "burnt his boats".</p>
