         <p>The drought continues, &amp; the outlines of a considerable public disaster begin to grow on the horizon. How oddly the universe is governed!</p>
         <p>I motored into Durham, and licensed two chaplains to the Seaman's Mission at South Shields and The Hartlepools. Then I returned to Auckland for lunch.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I motored to Newcastle where D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Mess had collected about 40 "business men" of Newcastle to "meet the Bishop of Durham".  We had tea, &amp; then I talked to them about the Problem of Tyneside, as disclosed in the Report which D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Mess has drawn up.  I spoke badly, for I had not prepared my speech.  Also, I filled up the "begging clip", pledging myself to subscribe &#x00A3;5 yearly for 3 years!!  Then I returned to Auckland.</p>
