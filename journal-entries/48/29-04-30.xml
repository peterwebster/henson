         </p>
         <p>A fine day but curiously cold, &amp; growing ever colder.</p>
         <p>Pelham &amp; I went into Durham, &amp; there I presided at the meeting of the York Provincial Sunday School Council, and delivered the Presidential Address, which I had written before leaving for France. The discussion was rambling and rather futile. I lunched at Bede College, &amp; presided over the afternoon's proceedings. Pelham is neither a lucid thinker nor a ready speaker. I had tea with the Dean, and then talked business with the Bishop of Jarrow. Ella &amp; Fearne joined me in the College, and we returned to Auckland together.</p>
         <p>The <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> publishes another of the wonderful photographs of wild animals, which Colonel Marcuswell Maxwell has taken in the wilds of Kenya and Tanganyika.  Lions, rhinoceroses and buffalo â€“ all in the most natural attitudes.  It is miraculous photography.</p>
