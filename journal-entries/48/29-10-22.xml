         <p>I wrote to Parry&#8211; Evans offering him the hon: canonry vacated by the death of Canon Collings.</p>
         <p>Also I wrote to Kenneth and to Lionel.</p>
         <p>I travelled to London by the 1.36 p.m. from Darlington, which brought me into King's Cross about 6.20 p.m. The train was rather crowded, and my carriage was disturbed by the ceaseless clamour of a small boy – 2 years old – whom his parents were quite unable to silence. I maintained a civil, almost indeed a benevolent demeanour; but I felt Herodian! On arriving in London, I drove at once to 21 Park Lane.</p>
         <p>I dined with mine host &amp; hostess.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Peel</hi> was the only other guest:  we had much, and interesting talk, and covered much ground.  I was interested to note that Lord Peel's view of the situation in Kenya was by no means favourable to the colonists.  He has had dealings with them over the Indians.</p>
