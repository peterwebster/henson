         <p>I began an article for the Bishoprick, on the name "Protestant" which passed into the vocabulary of Christendom just 400 years ago.</p>

<hi rend="italic">I accompanied Chelmsford to Mainsforth Colliery, where he formally opened the Pit&#8211;head Baths, which had been erected by the Miners' Welfare Fund. We began by going through the building, &amp; being shown the numerous arrangements for the man's convenience and comfort. Then we lunched in a tent very pleasantly. I sate between the Chairman, Mr. Dorman, of the firm Dorman Long &amp; C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">o</hi><hi rend="italic"> which owns the mine, and M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Ben Turner, the new Minister for Mines â€“ a tubby little fat man with the expansive geniality &amp; unctuous fervour of his professional mission&#8211;preacher.  After lunch there was a meeting of the workmen, who attended in large numbers.  I think there could hardly have been fewer than 2000 present.  Chelmsford spoke, &amp; then in succession Turner, Richardson, Robson, &amp; Straker.  The speakers seemed very </hi><hi rend="bold">[187] </hi>[symbol] <hi rend="italic">anxious to pose as disinterested reformers of society &amp; champions of the miners.  They were evidently </hi><hi rend="italic underline">intrigued</hi><hi rend="italic"> at seeing me there &amp; worked in some references to my presence.  After this function we returned to Auckland &amp; had tea.  Then we walked round the Park, deceiving the way with converse.</hi>

         <p>We had a dinner party. There dined</p>
