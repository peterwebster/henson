         <p>"Durham is the home of lost industries: at the beginning of the XIX<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century the county had a world&#8211;wide reputation for pottery, glass, carpets, linen, leather, mustard, and nails; for all practical purposes these industries are now extinct."</p>
         <p>(v. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Maud Sellars</hi> in <hi rend="underline">Victoria Court History</hi>, ii p. 276).</p>
         <p>It seems highly probable that the County will multiply titles to this piteous description – the home of lost industries.</p>
         <p>Lionel and I motored to Ushaw Moor where I consecrated a Churchyard, &amp; gave an address. Seven choirboys in their surplices faced the rain. I was so pleased that I gave them a shilling apiece. We motored to Durham and had tea with the Bishop of Jarrow. Then I went to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Oswald's, and instituted the New Vicar &#8211; Dunn from Swalwell – an elderly man with a fat shining bald head.  There was a large congregation including a strong contingent from Swalwell.  After the service we returned to Auckland. </p>
