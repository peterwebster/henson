         <p>I prepared notes for a sermon at the consecration of Easington Colliery Church tomorrow. Then I went to Durham, and licensed five curates, including Jimmie, whom I brought back to lunch at Auckland.</p>
         <p>I motored to Stanhope, and confirmed about 50 persons.  After the service I had tea at the rectory, <hi rend="bold underline">&amp; got into a considerable discussion with Shebeare about Modernism. He talks the usual windy nonsense about the unimportance of facts,&amp; the all sufficiency of 'values'. As if the values could long survibe the facts which created them!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>From Stanhope I went on to Tow Law, where I confirmed 113 persons â€“ 51 males and 62 females. The church was densely crowded: the candidates were serious &amp; attentive &amp;, in short, the service seemed to be impressive and edifying. We got back to Auckland Castle soon after 8.30 p.m. Tony Chute writes to tell me that he meditates exchanging Oxford for a parish in Winchester.</p>
