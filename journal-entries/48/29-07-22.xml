         <p>Lionel and I motored to Sunderland, where I took part in the ceremonial of <hi rend="bold">laying the Foundation Stone of the new church of S. Mary Magdalene</hi>.  We began with a service in the temporary church, <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> when I preached a sermon.  Then we proceeded to the site of the new church, <hi rend="bold">where foundation stones were laid by Sir John Priestman and M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript">r</hi><hi rend="bold"> Doxford</hi>. This was followed by a luncheon in the parish building, at which the foolish speeches common on such occasions were made, &amp; a vast amount of mutual compliment indulged in! Then Lionel and I went on to Newcastle, where I got my hair cut, and had tea there. Then we returned to Auckland picking up Ella in Durham on the way.</p>
         <p>In our absence Peers, the Board of Works Architect, had arrived, and Elizabeth Smith, lately returned from Italy.</p>
         <p>The weather was thunderous, and intermittently wet, but, though torrential rains were reported from Southern England, there is no clear token that the drought has reached an end.</p>
