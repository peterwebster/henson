         <p>Union, and prepared notes for the stone&#8211;laying this afternoon, &amp; then frittered away the morning very uselessly.</p>
         <p>Kenneth lunched here, &amp; accompanied Lionel and me to Chilton, where I laid the foundation of the new church, which is to replace that which was burned down. There was a considerable gathering of people, and the service was well&#8211;arranged. Before the function of stone&#8211;laying there was a service in the temporary church at which I preached a sermon.</p>
         <p>After my return to the Castle, I received a telegram informing me that Canon Brown had died at Northallerton this morning, &amp; that the funeral was arranged for next Thursday. This means that another of the better incumbents will be taken away from this depleted diocese to fill Brown's place. His death vacates an hon. Canonry.</p>
