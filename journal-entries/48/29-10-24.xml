         <p>I packed, and came away from Park Lane after breakfast.  Leaving my bags at the Club, I walked to Lambeth, where I found the meeting of Bishops had already begun.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Cantuar</hi> was on his legs, and, as usual, monstrously prolux [sic].</p>
         <p>If length of wind &amp; never&#8211;failing zest<lb/>One's voice to hear did Primates best equip,<lb/>Kind Providence hath served our own interest<lb/>In giving C_____ o in that chair to sit.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Liverpool raised the question of the definition of "<hi rend="underline">lawful authority</hi>" in the Declaration of Assent.  He himself understood it to mean the Bishop, and this view was warmly maintained by most of the bishops who spoke.  I opposed it, &amp; confessed the distress of conscience with which I now administered that declaration to the clergy.  That it <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> be maintained appears to me apparent.  The Law is the Englishman's security against mere individualism, whether of incumbent or of bishop.  Disestablishment is morally requisite <hi rend="strikethrough">by</hi> 
<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>before<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> episcopal direction can be substituted for "lawful authority".</p>

         <p>I must confess that the casuistry of my episcopal brethren is to me morally nauseating. It is also very perplexing, for they are in other respects acute, candid, and conscientious.</p>
         <p>I read through the novel <hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi>by<hi rend="sub">&#x032D;</hi> which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi> has been so impressed â€“ <hi rend="underline">Simon called Peter by</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Robert Keable</hi>.  It is the story of an Anglican Curate who goes as Chaplain to the Great War: becomes quickly disillusioned and deprived of his beliess: sinks into very squalid sensualities, and winds up as living with his mistress, flirting with Rome, and canting hideously about the love of God!  It is written with much grossness, and exalts a conception of happy human life which drears ever to the gutter and the brothel.  A healthy&#8211;minded lad ought to have no use for morbid nastiness of that kind.  </p>
         <p>I returned to the north by the 5.30 p.m. train. It was crawling with mine workers, &amp; carried also the Archbishop of York.</p>
