         <p>Edwin sent me a bundle of papers explaining his present <hi rend="underline">impasse</hi>.  <hi rend="bold underline">I sent him a cheque for &#x00A3;102</hi>: that being the exact amount of his indebtedness. Then I fell to work on a little sermon for the Speech day at Q. Ethelburger's School at Harrogate tomorrow. These silly "side&#8211;shows" devour time &amp; energy which could be better employed.</p>

The financial report was anything but satisfactory. It was decided that the Sunday question should be taken as the subject for discussion at the meeting of the Diocesan Conference on November 2</hi><hi rend="i superscript">nd</hi><hi rend="italic">.
