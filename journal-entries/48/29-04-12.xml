         <p>The <hi rend="bold underline">Hotel de France</hi> is finely placed, and our rooms command a noble prospect of the mountains.  The town has a clean &amp; flourishing aspect, and certainly makes a good first impression.  On the fine esplanade outside there is a dignified memorial <hi rend="underline">'Ã  nos morts glorieux'</hi>.</p>
         <p>Yesterday's 'Daily Mail' which we were able to buy at Carcassonne reports briefly a speech by <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Grey of Fallondon</hi> in which he gives a very cautious acceptance of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lloyd George'</hi>s Unemployment scheme. What an odious business is party politics! It is difficult to imagine anything more entirely repugnant to Lord Grey's frank &amp; honourable character than such debased electioneering craft as that scheme, beyond all question expresses, and yet he is a Liberal, and the ethics of party require him to support the party's official policy. It will be interesting to see how far the electorate, beyond all precedent inexperienced, will be captured by it: but I cannot avoid great anxiety.</p>

         <p>After dinner I wrote to Bayley and to my Godson, John Radford. It is difficult to determine whom one shall write to on a holiday. Beside the normal motive of affection there enters an element of calculation. An opportunity for improving relations with individuals is provided, which it would be impolitic not to seize. '<hi rend="underline">Being crafty I caught them with guile</hi>' says S. Paul describing his pastoral method, and we need not scruple to follow his example.  <hi rend="underline">No doubt it is true that foreign travel is now so common that it has lost much of its former interest: and one may be rather ludicrous than impressive when one dilates on scenes which are familiar to triteness. No letters are kept now, and very few are worth keeping. Still, there lingers a kind of romance about letters from abroad which makes them welcome, &amp; therefore worth writing</hi>.</p>
