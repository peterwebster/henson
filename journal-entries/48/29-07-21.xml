         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There was an increased number of communicants owing to the temporary closing of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Anne's Church in order that it might be cleaned.  I allowed such of the communicants there who willed to come here.  Two men, &amp; about a score of females came. </p>
         <p>I wrote to William &amp; Athelstan Riley. I motored to Staindrop, and dedicated the new chapel which has been arranged in the Parish Church. A small boy had been killed by a passing motor just after he had come away from the Sunday School. The poor child saw his father on the other side of the road, and rushed heedlessly to join him, coming into contact with the motor unavoidably, &amp; so perishing. I made some allusion in my sermon to this woeful event, which upset me greatly. Then, after service, I dined with Lord Barnard very pleasantly. He seems to me a good fellow at bottom, &amp; getting over his shyness.</p>
