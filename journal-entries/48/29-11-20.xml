<hi rend="bold doubleunderline">KNOWLDEN'S FUNERAL</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to West Hartlepool in order to attend the funeral of Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Knowlden</hi>. There was a large assemblage of clergy, and a considerable congregation of the parishioners &amp; townsfolk. All the service except the graveâ€“side prayers was taken in S<hi rend="superscript">t </hi>Aidan's Church. The distance to the cemetery was greater than I had been led to expect, so that the service was not over until nearly 1.30 p.m., and we did not get back to the Castle until 2.15 p.m.</p>
         <p>We returned to West Hartlepool in order to institute the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev. A.S. Thompson</hi> to the Vicarage of S<hi rend="superscript">t </hi>Paul's, from which <hi rend="doubleunderline">Turner</hi> retired.  There was a fair congregation, &amp; a large gathering of the clergy.  Before the service we called at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t </hi> Oswald's Vicarage in order to inquire after the state of Martin <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gillet</hi>, who is reported to be ill. He is one of the deacons who ought to be ordained to the priesthood next Advent, but he can't get to the Examination.</p>
