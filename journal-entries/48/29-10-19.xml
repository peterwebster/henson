         <p>A beautiful autumnal day, and distinctly colder. There was a white frost this morning. The leaves are coming down at a great pace. I spent the morning in completing the centenary sermon for S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Thomas, Sunderland.  In the afternoon I looked for awhile at the hockey and football matches.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Arthur Hird</hi> sends me 'for my personal reading' another book of D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> 
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Moffatt</hi><hi rend="underline">'s</hi> "<hi rend="underline">Love in the New Testament</hi>".  He accompanies with a characteristically oleaginous letter.  There is something about these sectaries which revolts me, though they probably mean well.  <hi rend="underline">But they live in a world of phrase&#8211;making, journalistic stunts, &amp; world&#8211;wide movements: &amp; they ever speak in superlatives. The voluntary system stimulates toadyism &amp; exorbitant mutual compliment, which I loathe. This habit of extravagant eulogy has become a governing convention: it colours the prayers, invades the pulpit, and dominates the platform. I become actually brutal under its infliction, and, perhaps, show my dislike too pointedly for politeness</hi>.</p>
