         <p>Lionel and I motored to Newcastle. There I attended a meeting in the Hall attached to the Cathedral of the clergy of Tyneside both North &amp; South. The Bishop of Newcastle presided, and I made a speech. There was a meagre discussion, which, however disclosed the presence in some of the Newcastle clergy of extreme opinions, Socialistic &amp; even Communistic, which promised ill for the success of any social effort. I lunched with Stephenson &amp; his curates, &amp; then went back to Newcastle &amp; had my hair cut etc. Lionel went to the Exhibition, &amp; handed over what was described as the "so&#8211;called" Butler coffee pot! Then we returned to Durham, where I saw the Bishop of Jarrow, &amp; had tea with Wilson. Then we returned to Auckland. At 6.20 p.m. we motored to Brandon, where I instituted the new Vicar (Tallents). There was a fair congregation, and about half a dozen of the local clergy. I spoke plainly about the necessity of the clergy keeping their promises at institution!</p>
