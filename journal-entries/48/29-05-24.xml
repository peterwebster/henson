         <p>A gloriously fine morning and very warm.</p>
         <p>I celebrated in the Chapel at 8 a.m., being much harassed by my cough. It being 'Empire day' I used the Prayer for the British Empire in the Revised Book, which I wrote myself. It is, of course, poor enough by comparison with the old collects, but among the modern compositions not, perhaps, conspicuously bad!</p>

         <p>All from Durham.</p>
         <p>On the whole my interviews with them impressed me well. I gave the 3 "Priests" copies of Lightfoot's Ordination Address, &amp; of my own "Church &amp; Parson in England".</p>

         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>Rawlinson came over from Durham to take a hand with the Ordination candidates: and I had some talk with him.  He is certainly a very decided "Anglo&#8211;Catholick", and his notions of discipline hardly accord with mine.  But he evidently desires to "do his bit" in the diocese, and he appears to commend himself to the clergy.  Richards came over, and Moulsdale.  They read the Lessons at Evensong.  Wallis was reported ill, but his address to the candidates was excellently read by Ganderton.  <hi rend="bold underline">For reading at meals I appointed Baxter's self&#8211;analysis in his Autobiography. It was "pretty" to hear Moulsdale read the heretick! Richards and Rawlinson read with appreciation. It is surprising how well Baxter serves the purpose. His style is curiously winning, the expression of a very winning character â€“ candid, childlike, and at the same time</hi> incisive &amp; even severe.  Baxter was a great spirit, and his greatness outweighs the absurdities and limitations of his religion, and the obsoleteness of his points of view.  He still interests and persuades men.</p>
