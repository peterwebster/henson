         </p>
         <p>Today I enter on '<hi rend="underline">the tenth year of our translation</hi>', and I mark it by writing a letter to the '<hi rend="underline">Spectator</hi>' in answer to one from Mr. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Boys&#8211;Smith</hi>, who appears to 'take himself very seriously'.   It is many years since I addressed a letter to the Spectator, and I doubt whether its circulation is now sufficiently considerable to make it worth while to choose its columns for anything.  But I thought it is helpful to clear my mind for a more elaborate criticism of <hi rend="doubleunderline">Boys&#8211;Smith</hi> which I have undertaken to contribute to the "Nineteenth Century &amp; After' in September.</p>
         <p>I sent pounsign5 to that very foolish creature, <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pestle</hi>, who owes a considerable sum to a local painter.  The man who writes to me, &amp; <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pestle</hi>'s plea is that he employed him out of charity! I have a horror of these altruistic fervours which, in their range over suffering humanity, disdain the humble obligations of paying one's debts, &amp;c!.</p>
