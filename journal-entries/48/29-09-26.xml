         <p>The Headmaster of Brigg Grammar School writes to invite me to be the "chief visitor for "Speech Day". He writes thus:&#8211;</p>
         <p>"Some time ago I learned with interest of your short connexion at one time with the School, and as a humble admirer of yourself when I was privileged to attend services at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's, I venture now to approach you with an invitation to visit the school."</p>
         <p>This carries me back a long way. I was at Brigg, if my memory does not betray me &#8211; for about a year before matriculating at Oxford in October 1881. This is nearly half a century ago.</p>
         <p>Pattinson and I motored to Pallion, a parish on the outskirts of Sunderland, and there I preached at a special service on the occasion of the re&#8211;opening of the parish church for use after having been closed for repairs etc. There was a good congregation. The new Vicar (Howlett) seems to be settling into the parish amicably.</p>
