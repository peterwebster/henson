         <p>A most beautiful autumnal day. Caröe went off after an early breakfast, promising me as he said farewell that he would have the chapel ready for use before December 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi>, when the portrait is to be presented.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning on another of those tiresome 'centenary' sermons. This is for S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Thomas's Sunderland, which was consecrated by Bishop Van Mildert on October 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 
1829.</p>
         <p>The Archdeacons &amp; Rural Deans arrived about 4 p.m.  There were 3 absentees on the score of illness – Knowlden, Wykes, &amp; Croudace.  After tea we had discussion for 2 hours, all very amicable if not particularly practical!  Then followed dinner, prayers, &amp; so to bed.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rawlinson</hi> tells me that he is a friend of "Father" Vernon, whom he has known well.   He regrets his seclusion, but is nowise surprised by it.  He suspects that its effect will be very disturbing on the considerable number of person who have built their spiritual life on their confidence in Vernon.</p>
