         </p>
         <p>We were called at 5.45 a.m. &amp; finished the packing before breakfasting at 6.45 a.m. The train left at 7.54 a.m. and arrived in Paris at 9.43 p.m. We journeyed in fair comfort, though incommoded by our fellow&#8211;travellers, two American "ladies", a mother &amp; daughter, who insisted on keeping the window closed all the way, pleading the bad health of the elder. The proximity of the lavatory made fresh air more than commonly desirable. We lunched at Bordeaux, where the train halted for 45 minutes, &amp; had tea and dinner on the train. The fineness of the day illumined the country, and we enjoyed many fair prospects. There was some delay in recovering our luggage at the Gare Quai d'Orsay, but we finally succeeded in getting into rooms at the Hotel Palais d'Orsay, which adjoins the station. We were sufficiently fatigued after our journey.</p>
