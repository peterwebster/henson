         <p>The publishers send me, at Rawlinson's request, the proof of a little book which he is about to issue:– </p>
         <p>"Church of England &amp; Church of Christ". He names Stubbs<persName xml:id="2924"></persName> as a Broad Churchman, but surely in error. When Stubbs became Bishop of Chester, his first difficulty was about the Eastward position which he desired to take, having done so in the parish churches which he served for 34 years, but which Dean Howson objected to his taking. He did take it. (v. Letters. p. 251 f.) His affinities were all with Tractarians, thought his loathing for religious affectation disgusted him with the fussier types of "Ritualist". M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> John Gamon, the Bishop's legal secretary, writes: "A High Churchman in principle of the most uncompromising views, any approach to Ritualism was distasteful to him". (p. 280)  He adopted a very rigid attitude on divorce, &amp; marriage with a deceased wife's sister. (p. 283)  He disliked the new criticism, and disapproved of 'Lux Mundi'.  Indeed, in spite of his great distinction as a historian, Stubbs was in his religion an unimaginative Tractarian.</p>

         <p>I went in to Durham, and presided at a meeting of the Church Building Board.  The business was over by 3.30 p.m.  Then I had tea with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi>, &amp; talked with him until 6 p.m., when I motored with <hi rend="doubleunderline">Pattinson</hi> to Marley Hill.  There I instituted (or admitted) <hi rend="doubleunderline">Probert</hi> to the perpetual curacy.  The mean little church was crowded with a very attentive congregation.  Nine of the local clergy attended; and everything seemed to be edifying enough.  <hi rend="doubleunderline">Probert</hi> himself has a very woebegone expression, a fact perhaps explicable by the quality of his wife, a little waspish woman with an awe–inspiring reputation!  He is hardly superior in education to the pitmen to whom he will minister, and in social type he is on their level.  His appointment by the Labour Prime Minister may probably indicate that he is himself a member of the Labour Party.  We have travelled far from the conventional platform description of the Establishment as securing a 'gentleman &amp; a scholar' in every parish!  After the service we returned to Auckland Castle; occupying about 50 minutes in the journey.</p>
