         <p>The papers report the sudden death of <hi rend="doubleunderline">James Parker Smith</hi> in a London Hotel.  He was 75.  It was but a few weeks since I met him at Kathleen's wedding.  How difficult it is to realize the nearness of death!  My contemporaries and even my juniors are passing quickly.  When will the summons come to me?</p>
         <p>I motored to Barnard Castle, and confirmed 40 candidates, of whom only 10 were males. The Rector, Bircham, was not present! After the service, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi>Bottomley, the accountant of the Durham County Council had an interview with me about his son, a rather undergrown youth, whom he wishes to send to Merton.  I promised to write to the Warden.  Then I motored to Staindrop, &amp;, after tea with Spurrier, I confirmed 77 persons in the parish church.  The sexes seemed to be about equally represented.  I asked Spurrier to undertake the work of overseeing the Lay Workers, as an understudy of Canon Pattinson <hi rend="underline">cum jure successionis</hi>, and he consented.</p>
