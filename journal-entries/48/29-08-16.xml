         <p>Ella had a numerous party, which was dispersed by rain.  <hi rend="bold underline">Lady Eden brought her grandson, Lord Warwick, a handsome boy of 19, who has just entered Sandhurst.</hi>  I showed him over the Castle, and found him both interested and interesting.  Campbell&#8211;Frazer brought the German Prince who was enthusiastic about Durham Cathedral.  He had seen York and then Durham, and greatly preferred the last.  This was very creditable to his good sense.  I was interested in a nice&#8211;looking lad, Mark Whittaker, 13 1/2 years old but taller than me, who was the step&#8211;son of General, &amp; son of Lady Helen Newcombe.  He told me that he was at Lancing, &amp; spoke of his mother (whose sudden death last week cast a gloom over Catterick Camp, where her husband General Newcombe was in command) very simply and affectionately.</p>
         <p>General George Smith, Ella's cousin, arrived on a visit. The evening was relieved by Di's singing, &amp; passed pleasantly enough. But guests in the house are totally destructive of my work!</p>
