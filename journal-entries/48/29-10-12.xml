         <p>Ella returned last night bringing with her Ethel Gore&#8211;Booth. <hi rend="bold">[</hi>Why is it that this excellent young woman irritates me so much? Is it her ceaseless flow of foolish interrogation?<hi rend="bold">]</hi>  She <hi rend="underline">said</hi> that I had promised to let her have the car for an expedition to Burnopfield!  So I made my way to Darlington by train with the result that I fell in with Kenneth again there.  He was going to Oxford by the same train that carried me to Nottingham.</p>
         <p>I arrived an hour earlier than I expected, and drove to S. Mary's Vicarage. There was a dinner party. The Principal and his wife: Mr. Boot &amp; his wife, a local C.O.S. lady, and mine host &amp; hostess. We talked pleasantly on many topics but nothing remained over for record. The local millionaire â€“ Sir Jessie Boot, now Lord Trent, has erected at his sole cost palatial new buildings for the University, which I shall see tomorrow.</p>
