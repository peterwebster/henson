<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Prideaux</hi><hi> came to lunch, and to say Goodbye before going to his new work in Damaraland. I am sorry to lose him from the diocese, for he is one of the very few clergymen who are also gentlemen.</hi></p>

<hi rend="bold underline">I worked on the Edinburgh lecture, &amp; wrote 14 pages.</hi><hi> It is a monstrous waste of time precisely when I want every minute for my proper tasks.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Old </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Halifax</hi><hi rend="italic"> writes to the '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Church Times'</hi><hi rend="italic"> to urge the clergy to disobey the Revised Prayer Book. Having fomented clerical lawâ€“breaking all his long life through, he will "die game". But it is an odd position for a zealous "Catholick" thus to preach revolt.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Church Family Newspaper stands strongly for Barnes, doubtless under the influence of Ralph, who is the mainstay of that journal.</hi><hi rend="italic"> The </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Guardian</hi><hi rend="italic"> is much gentler to him than might have been expected. Of course the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Church Times</hi><hi rend="italic"> is violently hostile, but its hostility rather assists his cause than injures it. Linetta writes to me from Birmingham an immense and vehement letter on his behalf. There seems a determination to give the episode the aspect of a "heresy hunt"; to ignore altogether the public aspect of Barnes's conduct, which is wholly indefensible, &amp; to concentrate attention on the particular issue raised by his sermons which is properly irrelevant.</hi></p>
