<p><hi>Beyond writing letters, and going to the Bank, I did nothing all the morning. After lunch I motored to Lambton and saw Lord Durham, with whom I talked over the formidable question of Durham Castle. Then, having finished with that subject, I spoke of the debate on the Prayer Book, &amp; urged him to be in his place, &amp; "vote straight" next week. He was more dubious than I had expected, but </hi><hi rend="bold underline">finally promised to follow me into the lobby in favour of the Resolution</hi><hi>. Pearson, the assistant curate of Felling, came to talk to me about his own plans. Should he accept another assistant curacy? He had been offered one in Essex. I dissuaded him from accepting it, and the ease with which he acceded to my counsel raised the suspicion in my mind that his real purpose in seeking an interview with me was indirectly to angle for a living!! I ordained him in my first year, so that he has now been seven years in Orders. He is a representative of the majority of the men who now become clergymen in the Church of England. They are of humble origin: of mediocre ability: of inferior education: and of unexceptionable character.</hi></p>
