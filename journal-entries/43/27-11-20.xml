<p><hi rend="bold">23</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rd</hi><hi rend="bold"> Sunday after Trinity. November 20</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8.a.m. We numbered 12 communicants including the 3 </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Brydens</hi><hi> and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">John</hi><hi>.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I wrote to an Edinburgh student named </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Traill</hi><hi>, who had sent me an album with the request that I would write something in it. He expressed himself so ardently that I could not but be kindly disposed towards him, &amp; therefore I not only did what he asked, but wrote him a civil letter &amp; sent him a copy of the '</hi><hi rend="underline">Continuity</hi><hi>' sermon. He had been in the congregation when I preached in S.Giles's, &amp; appears to have read several of my books. In these evil days, one is ready, perhaps too ready, to welcome disciples in any quarter!</hi></p>
<p><hi>After lunch I motored to Newcastle, &amp; there lectured on "</hi><hi rend="underline">England without Religion</hi><hi>" – this "stunt" title was not minted by me, but by the minister of the Congregational Church who had asked me to lecture – to around 500 people of both sexes, but mainly masculine, who were said to be largely school teachers. They listened with attention and at the close applauded with fervour. A reporter took away my notes. I had tea with Canon &amp; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Newson</hi><hi> and then went to Holy Trinity Jesmond &amp; preached at Evensong. There was a large congregation, but the acoustics of the church are bad &amp; I doubt whether my hearers were edified. </hi></p>
