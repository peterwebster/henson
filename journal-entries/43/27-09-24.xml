<p><hi>Miss Binnington went off after breakfast. I succeeded in finishing the Congress Sermon by lunch&#8211;time, but was mightily discontented with it. After lunch I walked round the Park. The afternoon post brought me the proof of my article on Quakerism. I sent it back with a short paragraph about "A Quaker Saint in Cornwall" added. This article reads worse than I expected, and will certainly please nobody.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">I paid &#x00A3;12.5.0 for last term's fees for young Derek Elliott, the red&#8211;headed lad whose father is said to have been murdered by the Communists.</hi></p>
<p><hi>The "</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>" devotes its first leader to the Revised Prayer Book. The opposition has certainly assumed larger proportions that at one time seemed possible; but the pressure of the Anglican opponents assisted by the natural desire to embarrass the Church has brought a considerable section of the Dissenters into the field, and Fanaticism can always count upon ample funds and ardent agitators!</hi></p>
