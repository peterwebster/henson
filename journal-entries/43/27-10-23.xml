<p><hi rend="bold">19</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold"> Sunday after Trinity, October 23</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. in the Chapel. We numbered but 6 communicants. Before getting up I read through again. Archbishop D'Arcy's "Science &amp; Creation: the Christian Interpretation". It is excellent &amp; contrasts in tone &amp; quality with Barnes's pronouncement: but, of course, the Irish Primate is a considerable philosopher, and the English Bishop is no Philosopher at all. I wrote to Lord Londonderry, and also to Robin.</hi></p>
<p><hi>After lunch we all motored to Durham, where I showed Miss Haldane the Chapter Library, the Galilee &amp; the Nine Altars before Evensong, after which we visited the Deanery, &amp; had tea with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Knight. Then I walked to the Vicarage of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Oswald's, &amp; had some talk with Morris before the service at Evensong. I preached wearily in a stifling atmosphere. After service we returned to Auckland.</hi></p>
<p><hi>The "</hi><hi rend="underline">Observer</hi><hi>" prints very prominently an article headed, </hi><hi rend="bold">"</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Future of the Primacy: Notes of the Bishops</hi><hi>". It discusses the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, &amp; the Bishop of Durham. It cannot be said to flatter the last, named gentleman. This modern fashion of writing about living persons is very objectionable, &amp; lends itself but too easily to abuse. There is no real reason why the Archbishop of Canterbury should resign, &amp; very little probability that he will. Miss Haldane, who knows him well, thinks that he won't.</hi></p>
