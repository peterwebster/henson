<p><hi>Ella and Fearne went off after an early lunch to Mount Grace to see Lady Bell's Pageant.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Braley<persName xml:id="5464"></persName> came to see me with reference to Dann's accusations, and set out his case. I bade him go more gently, &amp; swathe his iron glove in diplomatic velvet, &amp; so dismissed him. Then Jimmie appeared, and I talked with him for an hour. When he had disappeared I resumed the rather futile business of collecting notices of the Quakers, with a view to the Edinburgh Article.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Is it the timidity of incipient senility, or a real decay of intellectual power, that explains my strange reluctance, perhaps inability, to put hand to any serious composition? Talking is far easier than writing: and if I could transfer to my M.S. the words that run from my lips when I am interested in conversation, I think it possible that something relatively respectable might result. But I am halfâ€“paralyzed by my dislike of committing myself to any definite statement of opinion on any subject: and increasingly fastidious in the form of such pronouncements as I adventure!</hi></p>
