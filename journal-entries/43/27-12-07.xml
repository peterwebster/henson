<p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, December 7</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>The daily demands on my thought and strength are just enough to exhaust both, leaving no margin of either for the larger tasks of my Office.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lang</hi><hi> about the '</hi><hi rend="underline">Black Rubrick</hi><hi>', pointing out there was no real inconsistency between his position and mine: and then I fell to preparing a speech for the meeting of ^Society for^ the Prevention &amp; Rescue Work of the Diocese', which has its meeting here this afternoon. How to be </hi><hi rend="underline">relevant</hi><hi> without being also </hi><hi rend="underline">indecent</hi><hi> is not an easy question! The main handicap on this particular work is a </hi><hi rend="bold underline">profound and almost irremovable scepticism as to its practical value</hi><hi>. The State Room was well&#8211;filled, and I noticed a larger proportion of men, mainly clergy, than usual. I delivered my speech which was listened to attentively, &amp; then we all went into the Chapel where I received the "Women's Offering", which amounted to about &#x00A3;560. Everybody had tea, and then departed. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dick</hi><hi> and his wife went with me to Annfield Plain, where I explained to his churchfolk the new project for a temporary church, &amp; took the opportunity to speak about the new Prayer Book.</hi></p>
