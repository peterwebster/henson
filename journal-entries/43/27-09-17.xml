<p><hi>I never knew before the authority on which the statement, that there were 100,000 Quakers in England at the end of the 17</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century, rested. What Leslie's authority was I don't know. It may have been no more than current gossip.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Kenneth Hodgson came to lunch, and walked round the Park with me. I gave him much good advice, which he received with the demure acquiescence of oblivious youth!!

<p><hi rend="italic">How will this impudent secretary impress average folks? It is an odd situation that the practically unanimous opinion of the Episcopate should seem to count for nothing in the discussion. Yet in an episcopal church, the virtual repudiation of the episcopate means revolution.</hi></p>
