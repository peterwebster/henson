<p><hi>O God, Whose wisdom hath ordained that through sinful men Thy Will shall be made known, &amp; Thy Kingdom set forward in the world, have mercy upon us who have been called to the Ministry of Thy Church, and so strengthen us with Thy good Spirit that neither by word nor ill example we may sin against Thee through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Amen.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8.15 a.m. One of three candidate, though present, did not communicate. The Bishop of Jarrow came over for the Conference &amp; the Greek Testament Reading. His account of the situation at the Cathedral is not pleasing. </hi></p>
<p><hi>After lunch I walked round the Park, &amp; joined Lionel and Maish.</hi></p>
<p><hi>On returning to the Castle, I had tea, &amp; then talked with 3 candidates separately. Then came evensong, and my ''Charge'' was little more than a commentary on 1. Timothy. IV.12.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Jack Clayton appeared, and had much talk with me in my study after dinner. He seems well and cheerful. The Bishop of Salisbury evidently appreciates him. He showed me a letter from his Lordship expressed in very honourable terms. He has declined the offer of the Incumbency of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's, Clifton which was made to him by the Simeon Trustees.</hi></p>
