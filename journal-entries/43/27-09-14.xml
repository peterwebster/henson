<p><hi>A woeful wet day. I worked at the Article, which must be set off tomorrow. It made but small progress. The fact is that I work under the worst known condition of literary composition viz. a wealth of material &amp; a dearth of ideas! I really don't exactly know what it is that I desire to say about these demure &amp; concerted fanaticks. After lunch I walked round the Park in the rain with Lionel. Colonel Craster &amp; his wife (erstwhile Christian Car√∂e) arrived on a short visit. She is thin and dead, a melancholy condition for a comparatively young woman. Both of them had been reading "</hi><hi rend="underline">Mother India</hi><hi>", and both declared it to be true, yet not wholly fair, since it omitted the features of Indian life which tend to mitigate the unsavoury facts which it states.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Cook of Spennymoor wrote to accept Seaton Carew: the patronage of Spennymoor is in the Dean &amp; Chapter, and they must appoint somebody who has been at last 5 years in the diocese.</hi></p>
