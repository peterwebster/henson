<p><hi>I </hi><hi rend="bold underline">finished the Edinburgh Address</hi><hi>, and then motored to Durham, where I licensed curates in the Chapel of the Castle, lunched at the County Club with Wilson, interviewed five Ordination candidates in the Chapter Office, attended a lecture by Viscount Allenby<persName xml:id="5488"></persName>  on the Campaign in Palestine, and returned to Auckland.</hi>

<p><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Allenby</hi><hi rend="italic"> is a straight, strong man, with a masterful voice, &amp; a soldier's abruptness of speech. He looked quite adequate to the conspicuous role which he played during the Great War.

The patrons are a number of Low Churchfolk, among whom Drury and Miss Tristram are to be counted.</hi></p>
