<p><hi rend="bold">Friday, October 14</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I wasted the morning in reading through the Bishop of Chichester's pamphlet on the Prayer Book Measure, and considering it.</hi></p>
<p><hi>In the afternoon the Vice Chancellor came to see me about the Report on Durham Castle. He is evidently as puzzled as I am. The raising of £150000 is really out of the question in present circumstances; and yet, can we allow the Castle to fall down?</hi></p>
<p><hi>The drawing room meeting for C.M.S. was not as well attended as in former years: which was the more regrettable since the deputation, a young lady missionary from China, was superior to the average.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth Hodgson</hi><hi> goes into residence as Wadham today. He is very young, 17½, and has no better education than our local schools can give him. His County Council Scholarship of £80 per annum is his sole provision, save for my assistance. </hi><hi rend="underline">I hope he will "make good" for only so shall I be able to placate my conscience for spending on him money which is fearfully needed for so many nearer objects. He is good to look at, and desperately earnest; so I will hope for the best. </hi></p>
