<p><hi>'Two days ago I saw the greatest curiosity in London, aye and in England toâ€¦. I have seen Elizabeth Fry in Newgate, and I have witnessed there the miraculous effect of true christianity upon the most depraved of human beings. And yet the wretched outcasts have been tamed &amp; subdued by the christian eloquence of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Fry.'</hi></p>
<p><hi>The American Minister in 1917, quoted in D. N. B. 'Elizbeth Fry'.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I finished the Article on </hi><hi rend="underline">Quakerism</hi><hi>, and sent it to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Harold Fox</hi><hi>.

After lunch I walked round the Park with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Col. Craster</hi><hi>. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">J. G. Wilson</hi><hi> came to tea, &amp; went with me &amp; Lionel to Ebchester, where I instituted the new Rector, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Morgan</hi><hi>. The Church, dedicated to S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Ebba, is interesting. It was filled by a congregation almost entirely feminine. We returned by way of Lanchester &amp; Durham, dropping J. G. Wilson at his own door, &amp; arrived at the Castle about 9.5 p.m. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Binnington</hi><hi>, the sister of Gilbert's wife Lois arrived on a visit.</hi></p>
<p><hi>The weather today was fine &amp; fresh: but the evening paper reports a prodigious great rain&#8211;fall in the South of England. </hi></p>
