<p><hi>After breakfast </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Warre</hi><hi>, the Minister of S. Giles's called for me, &amp; motored me to the Cathedral, </hi><hi rend="bold underline">where I preached to a very large and attentive congregation.</hi><hi> The acoustics of this church were not thought to be good, but I was careful to follow the directions given to me, and was assurd [sic] that my sermon was well heard in every part of the Cathedral. Indeed the Minister asserted that my voice precisely suited the building, &amp; was "perfectly adapted' to it. After the service I was formally received by the Kirk Session, &amp; a pretty exchange of compliments took place! Then the church–officer showed me the very ornate little Chapel of the Thistle: after which the Minister took me to his house for lunch. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Alfred Ewing</hi><hi> the Principal of the University, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Professor Paterson </hi><hi>(who has grown to be very ancient and absent–minded) came to lunch, and several ladies including </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lady Salveson.</hi><hi> We had a good talk on theological matters, until </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh Lyon</hi><hi> carried me off to have tea with him and his wife. He &amp; I walked back to the Hotel where I dined, &amp; so departed.</hi></p>
