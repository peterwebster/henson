<hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Christianity is, among other things, a very wise, noble, and strange doctrine of life. Nothing so difficult to specify as the position it occupies with regard to asceticism. It is not ascetic. Christ was of all doctors (if you will let me use the word) one of the least ascetic. And yet there is a theory of living in the gospels which is curiously indefinable, &amp; leans towards ascetism on the one side, although it leans away from it on the other. In fact, ascetism is used therein as a means, not as an end…….</hi></p>
<p><hi>'Tis a strange world indeed, but there is a manifest God for those who care to look for him.</hi></p>
<p><hi>R. L. S. to his father. Feb. 15</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> 1878 v. Lie. p. 155.</hi></p>
<p><hi>This letter was written "sitting at a café in the Quarter Latin'. He adds a P. S. "This is a rare moment. Usually I hate to speak of what I really feel, to that extent that when I feel myself </hi><hi rend="underline">cornered,</hi><hi> I have a tendency to say the reverse". Was this letter a genuine uncovering of his soul? or, was it a kind little olive–branch to his religious parent?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">[158]</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">No less than 41 bishops attended the meting</hi><hi>. We sate from 10.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. with intervals for lunch and tea. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><hi> was present, and took part in the discussions. He showed no sign of humiliation or discouragement, and at lunch he sate beside the Archbishop in much parade of amity. He is plainly in a pugnacious mood. He told me that he has written a reply to the Archbishop. I implored him not to publish it. "Your duty &amp; your interest require you to take his Grace's rebuke in silence". "I am being strongly supported" he rejoined. "Yes, of course', I said, 'but from the wrong quarters". It is evident that he is far from realizing the situation into which he has brought himself. </hi><hi rend="bold">[</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pearce</hi><hi>, much to my disappointment, expresses himself in very bellicose fashion: and he even extenuates </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes's</hi><hi> anti–Sacramentalist outburst. I suspect that his rather </hi><hi rend="underline">borné</hi><hi> intelligence is unable to escape from the Protestant shibboleths on which he was reared, &amp; that his vanity enjoys the popular rôle of a Protestant Companion.</hi><hi rend="bold">]</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">[159]</hi></p>
<p><hi>After dinner I had some talk with the Archbishop. He expressed some surprise at </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes's</hi><hi> demeanour, and some disappointment. </hi><hi rend="underline">'' I was prepared to treat him with kindness: but I own that I hardly expected that he would show so little consciousness of his situation''</hi><hi>. His Grace said that he would receive </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes's</hi><hi> letter, which, of course, he would not answer. It was a weak production which would not help his case. </hi><hi rend="bold">[</hi><hi>He mentioned a distinguished lady doctor who had written to him (the Archbishop) saying that she would not scruple to certify </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Barnes</hi><hi> was insane on the ground of his curious obsession about the Sacrement!!!</hi><hi rend="bold">]</hi><hi>. We spoke of the procedure to be adopted in the House of Lords, when the Resolution about the Revised Prayer Book is moved. His Grace would introduce it, and the Archbishop of York would wind up the debate. </hi><hi rend="underline">He thought that I must certainly speak</hi><hi>. The Bishops of Norwich and Worcester would speak in opposition. He was inclined to think that it might be advisable to have the Resolution moved first in the House of Commons, </hi><hi rend="underline">where its prospects are brighter than in the House of Lords.</hi></p>
