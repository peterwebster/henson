<p><hi>This hotel, though crawling with golfers, a race which bores me beyond endurance, is comfortable &amp; well–equipped. I slept well, &amp; was called at 7 a.m. My first task was to write a "Collins" to Lady Londonderry.</hi></p>
<p><hi>After breakfast we walked on the cliff, sitting down at intervals to read M. Siegfried's acute analysis of the relations between the United States and Great Britain and France respectively.</hi></p>
<p><hi>We lunched with Lady Gore Booth, &amp; then motored with her to Lissadell where we spent the afternoon, returning to the hotel in time for dinner. Sir Josceline Gore–Booth is an elderly man, of irresolute aspect and jerkily dogmatic manner. He reminded me irresistibly of the feckless squire, Bertram, in "Guy Mannering". He showed us the House &amp; gardens – the one was dilapidated, &amp; the other full of weeds: but both were large &amp; impressive. He expressed no more illuminating judgement on the existing règime than the repeated assertion that a government of murderers by murderers could not last!</hi></p>
