<p><hi>I wrote to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Luce thanking him for his gift of the Confirmation Manual on Modernist lines which he has just published, and offering some criticisms. Also, I wrote to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Powicke, the Baxterian enthusiast.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I motored to Durham, lunched with the Bishop of Jarrow, discussed diocesan business with him for an hour, went to the Deaconnesses' House &amp; admitted the new Head to office, &amp; returned to Auckland. After a brief interval, I went to New Shildon, and "collated" Morris Young to the Vicarage of that parish. I returned to the Castle in time for dinner at 8.30 p.m. After dinner Di sang a number of songs, &amp; was much applauded.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Lord Coleridge's death is announced in the papers. Probably the three dignitaries now staying in this House are the three best&#8211;known Anglican ecclesiastics in the world &#8211; Inge, Foxley Norris, and myself: and Darling is probably the best&#8211;known of living English judges.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I received an interesting letter from George Nimmins, including two photographs of the pilgrims returning to Java after their pilgrimage to Mecca. He describes them as showing evident tokens of the harsh experiences of pilgrimage.</hi></p>
