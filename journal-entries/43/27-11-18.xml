<p><hi rend="bold">Friday, November 18</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold underline">I spent the day at this unsavoury committee, where we had the evidence of the Magistrates from the to metropolitan Courts, Bow Street &amp; Marlborough Street, which have most to do with "strict offences". </hi><hi>They impressed me as able, conscientious, and sympathetic men, who could be trusted to act justly and mercifully. The two least satisfactory features of the system they administer &#8211; the almost total dependence on the Police, and the practical futility of the Appeal which the law provides &#8211; appear to be almost irreformable.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I dined with the</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Lawrences</hi><hi> at 49 Marsham Street. The other guests were </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh Macmillan</hi><hi> &amp; his wife, Sir William &amp; Lady Clarke, the Dean of Westminster &amp; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Norris</hi><hi>, &amp; Miss Fry. We had much interesting conversation, mainly about politics. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh Macmillan</hi><hi> told us the history of his curious situation during the Labour Government when he, though a professed Conservative, held office as Lord Advocate of Scotland. Miss Fry and I shared a taxi as far as Park Lane.</hi></p>
