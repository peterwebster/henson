<p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, October 18</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>Lionel and I left the Castle a few minutes before 9 a.m., and motored to Barrow in Furness by way of Barnard Castle, Penrith, Pooley Bridge and Ulverston, &amp; we arrived at 12.35 p.m. having travelled 106 miles. Our road ran beside Lakes Ullswater &amp; Windermere, which showed all their glorious beauty in a bright sun. The autumnal colouring was exquisite. The Bishop of Carlisle and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi><hi>Williams gave us lunch at the Victoria Park Hotel, and then followed the meeting of the Diocesan Conference. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Major Birchall</hi><hi> and I were the 'invited speakers', and the subject was the Revised Prayer Book. I spoke first for about half an hour. The members listened attentively, and applauded adequately. It needs no saying that the atmosphere of the Hall was asphyxiating. I came away as soon as I decently could, &amp; we motored back to Auckland &#8211; 101 miles &#8211; by the main southerly route </hi><hi rend="underline">via</hi><hi> Kendal, arriving about 8 p.m.</hi></p>
<p><hi>The '</hi><hi rend="underline">Yorkshire Post</hi><hi>' and the '</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>' have leaders on the incident in S. Paul's, and both are unfriendly to the Bishop. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Turner</hi><hi> of Oxford writes in reply to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bethune Baker</hi><hi>: &amp; the </hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi> gives his letter a prominent place on its front page. This also is against the Bishop.</hi></p>
