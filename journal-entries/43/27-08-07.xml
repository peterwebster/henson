<p><hi>The heat during the night was intense, and much rain fell. Holy Communion was celebrated in the Chapel at 8.45 a.m. Ella and I communicated. As the rain continued to fall steadily, we remained indoors, reading &amp; writing letters. I wrote to Ernest, and to James.</hi></p>
<p><hi>In the afternoon Lord L. showed us the view from the octagonal building in the Park. At 5 p.m. there was Evensong in the Chapel. A male quartet from the Presbyterian Church in Newtownards sang "</hi><hi rend="underline">Rock of Ages</hi><hi>" as an anthem.</hi></p>

His gross impudent countenance stares at one from the front pages, &amp; his "revelations" of prison life fill the columns. It is no good evidence of public sanity that such a man can so move the interest of the masses. During the war this arch–swindler established a reputation for himself as "the soldier's friend", and no exposures of his frauds seem to affect the confidence of his </hi><hi rend="underline">clientèle</hi><hi>. Then to have been imprisoned is in these queer days a secure title to the regard &amp; admiration of the People!</hi></p>
