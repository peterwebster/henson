<p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, November 1</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1927.</hi></p>
<p><hi>My fatal month makes and ill start with a thoroughly ill&#8211;conditioned day, dull, wet, &amp; depressing. I wrote to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kenneth</hi><hi> in reply to a very affectionate note from him. he sent me the cheque for &#x00A3;35, which he had received on account of his GG scholarship. he is plainly beginning to enjoy Oxford. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Heaven grant that Oxford do not ruin him!</hi><hi> The whole morning was spent in writing letters. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Robin </hi><hi>came to lunch, &amp; talked with me for more than an hour afterwards. He is very confident that he will carry his constituency. He spoke very frankly about the desertion of Wynyard. I like him much, but he is very enigmatick. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Spencer Wade</hi><hi> brought wo of his parishioners to be privately confirmed. I performed the ceremony in the Chapel, &amp; then gave them tea. </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lionel </hi><hi>and I motored to Seaton Carew, picking up </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wilson</hi><hi> in Durham on the way. There I instituted </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cook</hi><hi> to the Vicarage, in presence of a large congregation, and in a stifling atmosphere. There was a considerable gathering of the ruri&#8211;decanal clergy, which was the more creditable since the weather was so unpleasant. After the service we returned to Auckland Castle, stopping in Durham to leave </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Wilson</hi><hi> on the way. </hi></p>
