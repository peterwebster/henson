         <p>I left King's Cross at 10 a.m., and was met by Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> with the car at Darlington shortly before 4 p.m. We motored to Sunderland, where I confirmed 92 candidates. Then we returned to the Castle, which we reached at 9.45 p.m. This confirmation did not greatly please me, for the clergy were all of the "advanced" type, and I felt that they were "waiting to catch something out of my mouth". No doubt, the report in the newspapers of last night's debate would have sharpened their suspicions. I doubt not that they have been busily engineering protests against Lord Buckmaster's<persName xml:id="3687"></persName> Bill from such well&#8211;informed and judicially&#8211;minded authorities as the "Mothers' Union<orgName xml:id="220"></orgName>" and the "Church of England Men's Society"!</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Muir Mackenzie</hi> sent me a pleasant note:&#8211; "<hi rend="underline">Admirable speech'. Much was expected, &amp; expectation was gratified</hi>." He added a suggestion that I should add my name to "a whip for the Committee stage", to be signed by "about half a dozen" peers. This suggestion I at once decided to reject because (&#x3B1;) I doubt the propriety of bishops entering so directly into the political process: and (&#x3B2;) I doubt the decency of a new peer in taking such prominence. Finally (&#x3B3;) I must needs attend the debates so infrequently that there appears to be a measure of unreality in my summoning anybody else to attend! I told Lord Scarbrough my decision, and he expressed approval.</p>
