         <p>I spent the morning in an improvised study. Here I wrote most part of a sermon for tomorrow's function at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Andrew's, Roker: and also some indispensable letters. After lunch we motored to Sunderland, and put up under the roof of Canon Gouldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>. As we passed through the streets, a child came near to suicide by running suddenly in front of the car. William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> jammed on the brakes, &amp; avoided the major disaster at the cost of a minor calamity. I heard an ugly sound which later was found to have been the snapping of the brakes! So the car is "hors de combat" for an indefinite period. A local doctor &amp; his wife came to dinner, &amp; we had some agreeable conversation. But I was depressed about the car, which just now is more than commonly needed. </p>
