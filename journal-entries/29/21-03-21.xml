         <p>In the Armies some of our hopeful professors turned drunkards, and when they came home, we could scarce recover them: some turned away from ministers, ordinances, scripture, godliness, from Christ, &amp; from common sobriety and civility. Some that sped best lament their coolings, distempers, &amp; discomposure of soul, &amp; are other men in peace, as to the beauty &amp; integrity of their lives than they were in war</p>

         <p>This is exactly what the clergy report of our returned warriors now. Clearly neither war nor human nature has changed. But the shock to morals was, perhaps, even greater in the XVII<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century than in the XX<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, at least in the case of the Puritans, who had been bred in a very stern and narrow view of duty, and whose whole scheme of virtue &amp; religion must have been roughly disallowed by the experiences of War. The nearest parallel to their case is provided by the Dissenting youth of the lower middles classes, who are said to have "gone to pieces" in the War with startling rapidity and completeness. No better account is given of the "shop&#8211;boy ritualist", whose religion had been a matter of "serving", candle&#8211;carrying, and confession, &amp; who found all these things either altogether inaccessible, or openly gibed at. Like the seed sown in the rocky ground they "had not much earth", and when the sun was risen soon faded and failed.</p>

         <p><hi rend="bold">[</hi>Bishop Kilner's death is announced in the papers. He was a kindly creature but of no great capacity, practical or intellectual. </p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fuller</hi> in the "Holy State" mentions the "<hi rend="underline">strange alteration in the world's valuing of those learned men who lived in</hi>" the XVI<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century. He refers particularly to the depreciation of the Marian martyrs, which was fashionable among the Laudian clergy. "<hi rend="underline">Thus the prices of Martyrs' ashes rise and fall in Smithfield&#8211;market</hi>." But <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fuller</hi> will not give up the "<hi rend="underline">reverend esteem of them</hi>" which he had learned from his parents: "<hi rend="underline">These bishops, ministers, and lay&#8211;people, who were put to death in Queen Mary's days, were worthy saints of God, holy &amp; godly men, but had their faults, failings, and imperfections. Had they not been men, they had not burnt; yea, had they not been more than men (by God's assistance,) they had not burnt. Every true Christian should, but none but strong Christians will, die at the stake</hi>." This is probably the final verdict of history on Queen Mary's victims.<hi rend="bold">]</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[</hi>Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName> and Paula<persName xml:id="2067"></persName>, consulting prudence before inclination, returned to London from this area of infection. I wrote warning Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> &amp; Major Slovach to keep away: and, on the same count, discountenanced a visit which Car&#x00F6;e<persName xml:id="648"></persName> wrote to propose. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I motored to Durham in order that I might interview the redoubtable People's Warden from Birtley in the Castle. D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Harrison is evidently "an ugly customer", for he is both intelligent and obstinate. Add that he appears to have an uncommonly strong case, &amp; it becomes plain enough that <hi rend="bold">[228] </hi>this fatuous vicar has little prospect of an easy time. It seems that Birtley is a parish with very strong Protestant traditions: and that Barclay<persName xml:id="5283"></persName>, inspired by a curate more "advanced" than himself, set these flagrantly at nought, and has alienated all the older people. D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> H. shewed me a memorial signed by nearly 200 parishioners, protesting against the Vicar's innovations. This was 2 years old, and had been handed to him on his election as people's churchwarden. The Vicar seems to be shifty and tactless: he can neither command his temper, nor keep his word. Thus the vestry meetings become scandalous scenes of recrimination &amp; mutual abuse. There is no possibility of restoring peace while the present incumbent holds office: but how is he to be got out? One extremely painful circumstance was stated by <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Harrison</hi> as not infrequent&#8211;the taking away from the church of the consecrated wafers, &amp; casting them away outside! This shocking profanity might give pause even to a zealous "Anglo&#8211;Catholick". The children are being with&#8211;holden from confirmation because their parents object to the teaching which the Vicar gives them! It is the too&#8211;familiar story. The Incumbent is foisting what he calls "the Catholick Faith" on a people, whose whole mental attitude is Protestant. The inevitable perplexity might be tolerable, if the Incumbent were himself an attractive &amp; judicious man. As he happens to be both unattractive, and amazingly stupid and pigheaded, the exasperation caused by his official proceedings is extreme. Indeed, I see no way out of the mess except the difficult one of shunting him.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[229]</hi></p>
         <p>Cruickshank<persName xml:id="1898"></persName> came to the Castle at my request, and I consulted him about this hateful business at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Oswald's. He thinks that nothing can be done while Loxley yet lingers, &amp; then he is clearly against any course that would cause scandal. </p>
         <p>We motored to Monkwearmouth, and there I confirmed 206 candidates in the parish church. The service was reverent &amp; well&#8211;arranged: but the atmosphere was asphyxiating. This church has a Saxon Tower and Western Wall, which are thought to be as old as the time of the Venerable Bede. We returned to the Castle after the service arriving about 10.30 p.m.</p>
         <p>I wrote to Godfrey<persName xml:id="2685"></persName> urging him to be vigilant against any attempt to hustle the Parochial Councils Bill through Parliament. The Ecclesiastical Committee has been summoned to meet tomorrow, and I suspect an intention on the part of his Grace to hurry the matter. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Muir Mackenzie</hi> writes, however, in a re&#8211;assuring tone. </p>
         <p>"It is doubtful whether the Ecclesiastical Committee will get through the Measure before Easter, even if it does, the Report could not get on to the paper of the House for a few days, &amp; the very most which could happen would be that it might be set down for the first sitting day after Easter, but I don't think that is the least likely, indeed I should remonstrate myself." If an opportunity offers, my present mind is to intervene with a speech, when the Resolution is moved in the H. of L.</p>
