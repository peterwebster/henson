         <p>Assisted by William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>, who proved himself most efficient, I laboured at the work of getting my books into the cases in some recognizable order. More would have been achieved if I had not been called away, in order to see M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Watts, the Vicar of Shildon, who is in difficulties in his parish. Lord Thurlow<persName xml:id="5272"></persName> came to tea, &amp; I suggested the possibility of his curate occupying the Lodge, &amp; his curate's house&#8211;keeper keeping the gate.</p>
         <p>I took down from Bishop Moule's book&#8211;shelves an edition of Durel's Latin version of the Caroline Prayer&#8211;Book, published in 1670. <hi rend="bold underline">It invariably renders "priest" by "presbyter",</hi> and may be taken as giving the view accepted by the ecclesiastical authorities of the day.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Bishop of Peterboro is to be one of the speakers at the meeting in the Albert Hall on December 4</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> to protest against reprisals. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I refused Sir Henry Bentinck's request to preside, so he presides himself</hi><hi rend="i bold">! </hi><hi rend="italic">Reprisals are, of course, extremely regrettable, and ought to be restrained as far as possible: but, in the terrible circumstances of the situation in Ireland at this moment, who can honestly say that he thinks it </hi><hi rend="italic underline">is</hi><hi rend="italic"> possible to prohibit reprisals? And, if this be the case, how can any right&#8211;minded citizen join in an agitation which cannot but have the effect of embarrassing the Government in handling a most difficult situation? We owe something to the policemen and soldiers in Ireland who are fighting our cause against the basest &amp; cunningest of enemies.</hi></p>
