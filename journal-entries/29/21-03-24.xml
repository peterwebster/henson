         <p>Of what is martyrdom the test? Certainly not of truth. Is it even a test of sincerity? I doubt it, for I cannot place limits to morbid vanity, or to sheer obstinacy, or to fidelity to a prescribed formula.</p>
         <p>Major S. and M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> J. arrived from Durham in a motor&#8211;car: and I had interviews with them both individually, and separately. These left me in greater perplexity than ever.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">I wrote to the Archdeacon<persName xml:id="590"></persName> asking him whether he could suggest any method of shifting Barclay<persName xml:id="5283"></persName> from Birtley. The man is quite hopeless where he is. He is but typical of many clergymen, who seem quite destitute of any sense of proportion. The sophistries by which they enlist their consciences in courses of action which seem inconsistent with the plainest morality are many, subtle, and surprising. Whatsoever accords with the "Catholick Tradition" is binding on them: nothing that conflicts with the "Catholick Tradition" has any claim on their acceptance. But they take their pledges to the English Church: therefore all their pledges are contingent on their agreement with another authority, and this they define for themselves. In effect, therefore, their "Catholicism" expresses itself in the most shameless and absolute individualism.</hi></p>
