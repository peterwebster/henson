         <p>A fair morning, 'bright shining after rain'. The beauty of this place grows on me daily: and, perhaps, deflects my judgement on the question of episcopal houses. Who shall say? The last thing one learns to know is the way of one's own mind. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m.</p>
         <p>We all motored to Durham, and arrived in good time for the "University service" at 11 a.m. There was a great congregation: the colleges of every kind being well represented. The Archbishop of Canterbury sate in the stall beside the Dean, having broken his journey on the road to Scotland, where he is to address the General Assemblies on the Lambeth Appeal. I preached from Ephesians V. 15.17: and was attentively listened to, though I suspect that everybody expected a more "topical" sermon. After service I had a few words with the Archbishop, &amp; made him watch the Cadets from the school form up, &amp; march off. Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I lunched with the Dean<persName xml:id="114"></persName>. At 3.30 p.m. I addressed the members of the D.S.C.C.U. in S. Cuthbert's: and afterwards had tea with the President in the Castle. Some students came, &amp; talked pleasantly enough. Then I recovered the ladies, and returned to the Castle.</p>
         <p>The weather became showery and chilly. <hi rend="bold underline">I was not sorry to find that a fire had been lighted in my study, though, in view of the continuing strike, it is an indefensible luxury</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi></p>
