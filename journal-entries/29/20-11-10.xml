         <p>I read through the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Ely's</hi> reply to Canon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Glazebrook</hi>&#8211;"The Creed and the New Testament." It is arranged on the old tiresome plan of quotation followed by answer. <hi rend="bold underline">His Lordship scores on the small points, and fails on the main position</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>Glazebrook is peculiarly vulnerable to the kind of hair&#8211;splitting criticism in which Chase excels. The point he succeeds in making &#8211; that S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul was orthodox, is not really worth making, for nothing any longer turns on it.</p>
         <p>Five more volumes of the Loeb classics arrived. The price has now risen to 10/&#8211; a volume. The range of the series is well illustrated by the latest issues. They are the following:&#8211;</p>
         <div type="verse">
         <p>Seneca. Ad Lucilium Epistuloe Morales.</p>
         <p>Martial. Epigrams.</p>
         <p>Marcus Cornelius Fronto. Correspondence.</p>
         <p>Thucydides.</p>
         <p>Plutarch. Lives.</p>

         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to the Bishop of Ely, indicating very politely my feeling that his argument, effective enough in its way, was not really relevant to the main question.</hi></p>
