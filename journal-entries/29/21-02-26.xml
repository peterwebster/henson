         <p>"It is now our glory &amp; felicity, that God has changed men's tempers with the times, &amp; made a spirit of building succeed a spirit of pulling down: by a miraculous revolution, reducing many from the head of a triumphant rebellion to their old condition of masons, smiths, &amp; carpenters, that in this capacity they might repair what, as colonels &amp; captains, they had ruined and defaced."</p>

I gave an address which took about 20 minutes to deliver, and then the business went on, with an interval for lunch, until about 4 p.m. I lunched and had tea with the <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop of Jarrow</hi><persName xml:id="2785"></persName>. Picking up <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Thurlow</hi><persName xml:id="5272"></persName> and his wife, I took them back with me to Bishop Auckland. There were no exciting episodes, and <hi rend="bold underline">I think the general impression was left that the Bishop was a good Chairman, with a fondness for doing business rapidly</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi>I did not speak much, save for introducing a few observations by way of restraining the "naked &amp; not ashamed" tendency disclosed in the discussion on the "Preventive and Rescue Agency".</p>
