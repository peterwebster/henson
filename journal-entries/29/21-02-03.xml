         <p>Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName> walked with me as far as the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>: our conversation was maintained under the double disadvantage of continuing noise &amp; an incipient fog. <hi rend="bold underline">I spent the day in the National Assembly</hi><hi rend="bold">,</hi> where the committee stage on the Parochial Councils Bill was finally disposed of. Lord Phillimore<persName xml:id="1940"></persName> moved a resolution (i.e. a new clause) as to the position of the Churchwardens, &amp; in his speech he described me humourously as "superstitious". I "got my own back" by saying that "I recognized Lord P. as an authority on superstition, &amp; that if, indeed, I desired to pass as an exponent of superstition, I could desire no better credential than a certificate from his Lordship". The voting went against Lord P. A vulgar, ranting speech by the Bishop of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Alban's (Furse) pleased a section of the assembly, but distressed all whose opinion was worth anything. Lang generally co&#8211;operated with me in the debate.</p>
         <p>Harold<persName xml:id="113"></persName> met me with the motor, which he recommends me to purchase. for &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">600</hi>. I dined with Miss Mundella<persName xml:id="2712"></persName>. A dense fog enveloped the West End, &amp; I was grateful for the kindly guidance of a lady with a lamp, who had been attending the Congress. Sir Charles Munro &amp; his wife were there, and Godfrey<persName xml:id="2685"></persName> &amp; Dorothy<persName xml:id="2768"></persName>. On the whole a pleasant evening. I went &amp; returned by the underground at the cost of ten pence. I got back about 11.15 p.m.</p>
