         <p>I read another of Wicksteed's<persName xml:id="4444"></persName> Lectures before breakfast. After doing the letters, I settled to the Railwaymen's sermon until luncheon. After lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I motored to Durham. There I called on Hughes, &amp; discussed the great question of his accepting Pittington, if it should (as appears probable) be offered to him. I was decided in the affirmative. On my return to the Castle, I found Lady Thurlow waiting for me with an estimate of work to be done in the Lodge preparatory to the entrance of the Glynnes. I assented to an expenditure of about &#x00A3;30.</p>

         <p><hi rend="italic">This message I telegraphed to the New York World in response to a request, accompanied by a prepaid telegram. </hi>It is a foolish practice, now generally adopted by newspaper men, thus to collect &amp; publish the opinions of such individuals as in their opinion the public care about. Their own interest in the business is obvious enough, for they can get much good 'copy' for nothing: but I doubt whether the public is impressed, &amp; I am sure that the individuals, whose opinions have been extracted, are profusely bored by the whole silly procedure, into which, without their leave &amp; against their wishes, they have been brought.</p>
