         <p>Edgar Dobie wrote me a quaint affectionate letter in which he tells me that he has 'sometimes to champion my cause â€“ often against very ordinary people, who do not wish to reason, but who oppose on principal, &amp; certainly will not be convinced.'</p>
         <p>'I have defended to the best of my ability, and have wished you could be there personally. I am always comforted when I say to myself. "They do not know him and I do; &amp; I love him because I know him". That is a touching expression of loyalty from an old Durham chorister. I do not mind much the misrepresentation &amp; insult of the 'Church Times' on my own account, but I do regret the distress &amp; disturbance of mind caused to so many persons, clergy &amp; laity, who do not know how far partisanship will carry men, &amp; are at the mercy of what they read. Probably the continuing denunciation of the Bishop in the newspaper which they read regularly with religious devotion does affect their minds, &amp; make episcopal government more difficult.</p>
