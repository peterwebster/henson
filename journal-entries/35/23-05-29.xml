         <p>I wasted the morning in writing to the Bishop of Chelmsford, from whom the post brought me a letter. Cruickshank<persName xml:id="1898"></persName> writes to me urging me to "Overcome my natural repugnance to approach him", as he appears, in spite of his cant, to agree with my "positive policy". I doubt if he is really a free agent, for his foible of playing the part of reconciler carries him into dangerous companies in which he commits himself to more than he realizes.</p>
         <p>Philps from Stanley lunched here to meet Wynne&#8211;Willson<persName xml:id="4448"></persName>. After lunch W.W. and Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> accompanied me to Trimdon where I confirmed 50 persons, &amp; afterwards had tea in the Vicarage. The Vicar, Rev<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> F. A. Rainbow, was ordained in 1912; is married, &amp; has 3 young children. His official income is said to be only &#x00A3;211. He presented 19 candidates out of a population which is hardly 1000. I motored to Sedgefield, and showed W.W. the church. We called at the Rectory. Then we went to Kelloe, &amp; confirmed something more than 50 persons, nearly all female. The Vicar, Canon Martin, is 80, and evidently very ill: but I could not conceal from myself that the parish was in a bad state. It ought to net nearly poundsign1100. Hence the calamity of aged incumbents. We returned to <placeName xml:id="55">Auckland Castle</placeName> after the service, arriving about 9.15 p.m.</p>
