         <p>Car&#x00F6;e<persName xml:id="648"></persName> arrived about 10.30 a.m., and went at once to his work. I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Aleck Lawrence, &amp; Iremonger<persName xml:id="4290"></persName>: &amp; then settled down to a sermon for Westminster Abbey.

His anti&#8211;Christian bias is, of course, very apparent, but it does not seem to deflect his historical judgment, and even the most devoted Christian must admit that Cyril &amp; his contemporaries were an odious crew.
