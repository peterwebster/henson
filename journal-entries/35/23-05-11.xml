         <p>I wrote a sermon for the Freemasons taking occasion to urge them to cooperate in forming public opinion in support of the effort to restrain publication of Divorce Trials. I went in to Durham &amp; lunched in the Castle with the two Archdeacons<persName xml:id="2785"><persName xml:id="3688"></persName></persName> &amp; Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>. After lunch I discussed some matters of diocesan business with them, and then motored to Stockton, where I confirmed a consumptive girl, &amp; had interviews with Douglas and Purvis on the subject of the Commission on Church Extension in that town. Then I returned to Auckland, where I found that General Kirkpatrick with his wife and two daughters had arrived. He leaves England next Friday to take up his command in Quetta.</p>
