         <p>I wrote many cheques in payment of household bills, and many letters. Then I motored to Durham, and instituted the new Vicar of Kimblesworth. Also I licensed 4 curates. After this I lunched with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>: &amp; then returned to Auckland. Here Edgar Dobbie<persName xml:id="3572"></persName> came to see me, &amp; talked for half an hour. Then I played bowls with the General. After tea I wrote letters until dinner. Major Dewhurst came to dine. After the ladies had retired, I had a good deal of very interesting conversation with the General. He says that the use of aeroplanes on the Indian frontier has destroyed the old chivalrous practice of sparing women in warfare.</p>
