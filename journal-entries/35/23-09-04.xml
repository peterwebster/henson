         <p>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> and I left Brockham End about 10 a.m., and motored to <hi rend="underline">Rode Hall</hi> in Cheshire, a distance of 151 miles. We stopped at Tewkesbury to see the glorious Abbey Church, and to lunch at the Bell. We had tea at Wellington, &amp; arrived at our destination about 6.30 p.m. We found the Headmaster of Harrow &amp; his son Jack staying in the house, as well as <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir John Kennaway</hi> &amp; his unmarried sister. </p>
         <p>I had scarcely before had speech with <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi> <hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline"> Ford</hi>. He gave me the impression of a mild, rather timorously cautious man, who would not lightly commit himself to any opinion that might be controverted. <hi rend="bold underline">He did, however, express a strong dislike of the Anglo&#8211;Catholic movement.</hi> Mine host is evidently nowise contented with the course &amp; conduct of the National Assembly, to which he is devoting so much time and energy.</p>
