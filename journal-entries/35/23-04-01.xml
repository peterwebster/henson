         <p>But Easter Day breaks! But</p>
         <p>Christ rises! Mercy every way</p>
         <p>Is infinite, â€“ and who can say?</p>

         <p>A dull rainy morning, very depressing to heart and mind.</p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were 12 communicants, including William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> &amp; John. Ashton, the Park&#8211;keeper, with his wife and daughter came also.</p>
         <p>I motored to <hi rend="underline">S. Helen's, Auckland</hi>, where I preached &amp; celebrated the Holy Communion at 10.30 a.m. There were 152 communicants, almost all very young men &amp; women. In administering the Elements, after using the full formula at the start, we merely said the opening words:&#8211; 'The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee.' This arrangement was expeditious, and appeared to work without irreverence.</p>
         <p>We all motored to <hi rend="underline">Durham</hi> for Evensong in the Cathedral. I sate in the Throne, &amp; pronounced the Benediction. Immediately after the service we motored to <hi rend="underline">Kirk Merrington</hi>, where we had tea in the Vicarage before going to church for Evensong. I read the lessons and preached. The church was filled with a congregation remarkable for the large proportion of young men which it included: &amp; they were all very attentive. We returned to Auckland after the service.</p>
