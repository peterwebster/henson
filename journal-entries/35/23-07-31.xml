         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fuller</hi> expresses his obligation to Archbishop Usher very quaintly in Bk. ii. of his "<hi rend="underline">Church History of Britain</hi>". He compares himself to a retail&#8211;trader "parcelling out pennyworths of commodities to those whose purses cannot extend to buy by wholesale from the merchant":</p>

         <p>"Conceive I in like manner my pains will be altogether unprofitable, who in this history have fetched my wares from the storehouse of that reverent prelate, <hi rend="underline">the Cape&#8211;merchant of all learning</hi>, &amp; here in little remnants deliver them out to petty&#8211;country&#8211;chapmen, who hitherto have not had the hap or happiness to understand the original treasuries whence they are taken …….</p>
         <p>Long may he live for the glory of God, &amp; good of his church. For whereas many learned men, though they be deep abysses of knowledge, yet (like the Caspian sea, receiving all, &amp; having no outlet) are loath to impart aught to others; this bright sun is as bountiful to deal abroad his beams, as such dark dales as myself are glad &amp; delighted to receive them."</p>

         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Fawkes</hi> writes that he has "read with delight the Durham&#8211;Zanzibar letters in the Morning Post." He adds: "In spite of a certain friction at the Congress, the Anglo&#8211;Catholics will, I think, go with Zanzibar – who has certainly nailed his colours to the mast. We now know what to expect: the other side won't deal!" I am disposed to agree with this forecast.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[140]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p>We (i.e. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName>, Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I) motored to <hi rend="underline">Muggleswick</hi>, where we lunched with old M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ritson<persName xml:id="3822"></persName>, and attended the Institution of Canon Poole to the perpetual curacy. There was a small congregation in the little church, including M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Poole in a lachrymose condition!</p>
         <p>After the service we motored back to Auckland. Our view of the moors was spoiled by rain which forced us reluctantly to close the car. After tea, we again left the Castle, &amp; motored to <hi rend="underline">Kelloe</hi> where I instituted <hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi> <hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Short</hi> to the Vicarage. The church was quite full, the parochial congregation being swollen by a strong contingent from West Auckland. After service we returned to Auckland where we arrived shortly after 9 p.m.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">These public institutions are, I think, useful. They attract considerable congregations, and give me the opportunity of saying things about the Christian Ministry, &amp; the Ministry of the English clergyman, which it is important to have said at the present time. If the service takes place on a week&#8211;night, the neighbouring clergy attend, &amp; are reminded of their pastoral obligations. Moreover, the service itself is very impressive, &amp; exhibits the bishop at the height of his theoretical authority. This circumstance also has a certain importance in days when so many influences tend to belittle episcopal authority. By what means the Anglo&#8211;Catholics succeed in reconciling their consciences to the necessity of taking these oaths, &amp; making this declaration, I cannot imagine.</hi></p>
