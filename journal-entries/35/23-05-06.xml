         <div type="quote">
         <p>O Lord, from whom all good things do come; Grant to us thy humble servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
         <p>Amen.</p>
         </div>
         <p>This is a very perfect little sweet prayer for personal use. It can go into the singular without any straining, &amp; it does just utter what one feels.</p>
         <p>After the rain last night the sun is again shining gloriously: the air is soft and genial: the country gleams with the hope &amp; vitality of the spring. Who would live in towns who could live his life out of them?</p>
         <p>Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> went with me to Shildon where I celebrated the Holy Communion &amp; preached by way of formally inaugurating the six days mission of Devotion &amp; Instruction which has been arranged in this Rural Deanery. There was a considerable number of communicants, and, if the atmosphere had not been asphyxiating, the service would have been apparently successful.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The Freemasons' Service in the Chapel was attended by something over 300 men, &amp; was, I think, very successful. The singing was very impressive, &amp; the collection for the Durham Charities amounted to &#x00A3;20</hi> <hi rend="bold">.</hi></p>
         <p>I preached in New Shildon Church at Evensong to a crowded congregation. Watts carried the pastoral staff, &amp; read the lessons. Shaddick read the service; and I preached. On the whole I think the mission has made a good start in these parishes. After dinner I had a "heart to heart" talk with Ernest.</p>
