         <p>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> motored me to Darlington for the early train. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Strong</hi> came into the train on the way, &amp; we had much discussion together. <hi rend="bold underline">He declared his intention of supporting me in debate</hi>. I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and there fell in with the Bishop of Bradford, who introduced his son to me as one who would presently seek Ordination in my diocese. Then I went to Westminster, and attended the meeting of the <hi rend="bold doubleunderline">House of Bishops</hi> <hi rend="bold">.</hi> The Archbishop wasted an hour in a tiresome &amp; superfluous historical retrospect. Then the Bishop of Chichester introduced the measure, and was seconded by the Bishop of Truro: <hi rend="bold underline">I followed in a 20 minutes speech, which was applauded by the "gallery", but found rather disturbing by my brethren</hi> <hi rend="bold">!</hi> Then the debate stood over until tomorrow morning when the Bishop of Ripon will take up his parable. <hi rend="doubleunderline">If</hi> the papers report me fairly, my speech will serve to set out the policy I advocate fairly enough, but it is a big 'if'. Then I went to the Athenaeum, and had tea. Tallents, Charles<persName xml:id="1820"></persName>, and Gamble were all in the club, and I had some conversation with them severally. Then I dined with Graves of the Spectator as my table companion: and then I went to bed. </p>
