         <p>Shortly then, I doubt not but I may, notwithstanding great authorities to the contrary, safely resolve that <hi rend="underline">in the case of divorce it is lawful for the innocent party to marry</hi>. But for that I find the Church of England hitherto somewhat tender in the point, &amp; this practice, where it rarely falls, generally held, though not sinful, yet of ill report, &amp; obnoxious to various censures; I should therefore earnestly advise &amp; exhort those whom it might concern carefully &amp; effectively to apply themselves to the forementioned remedies: reconciliation, if it be possible, to prevent a divorce; holy endeavours of a continued continence, if it be attained, to prevent a second marriage after divorce. <hi rend="underline">But if these prevail not, I dare not lay a load upon any man's conscience which God hath not burdened: I dare not ensnare those whom God will have free.</hi></p>
