         <p>Alexander<persName xml:id="5214"></persName> tells me that the thrushes &amp; blackbirds which are nesting in the garden have been disturbed, their eggs taken &amp; their nests destroyed. This is sad hearing, all the more sad since there is no remedy.</p>
         <p>Two clergy interrupted me â€“ Hurrell, the Vicar of Hunwick, who wishes to apply for the living of Colne Eugaine in Essex, &amp; Fyffe, Vicar of Cornforth, who seeks to explain how a layman occupied his pulpit without my permission. I motored to Heighington, where I confirmed 42 persons. Then I went to Darlington, &amp; took train to York, where Convocation begins tomorrow. The Archbishop's car met the train, &amp; carried me &amp; several other bishops to Bishopthorpe. In all there were 9 bishops assembled. We had much pleasant converse: &amp; I gathered that there was a general feeling that we might usefully discuss the reform of the courts in July.</p>
