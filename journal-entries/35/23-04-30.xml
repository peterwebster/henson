         <p>I called on Vernon Storr<persName xml:id="1899"></persName>, and talked with him for 3/4 of an hour. Then I went to Lee, &amp; paid my taxes. Next, I called on Downing at the Ecclesiastical Commission. Then I called on the Dean of Westminster<persName xml:id="325"></persName>. After an early and scanty lunch at the Club, I went to King's Cross, &amp; caught the 1.20 p.m. express arriving at Darlington shortly after 6 p.m. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> came to meet me.</p>
