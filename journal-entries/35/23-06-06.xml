         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury</hi>; and paid the household accounts. Then I motored to Durham, &amp; licensed 3 clergy. I lunched with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>, who had a friend, Arglas staying with him, who is a member of the National Assembly.

I returned to Auckland, and had an interview with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Hustler, the managing director of the Horden Collieries.</p>
