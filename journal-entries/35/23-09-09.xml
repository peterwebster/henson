         <p>Keep, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy Church with thy perpetual mercy: and, because the frailty of man without thee cannot but fall, keep us ever by thy help from all things hurtful, and lead us to all things profitable to our salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the Chapel at 8 a.m. There were in all 11 communicants, among them William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>. My guests were taken to church by <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>, <hi rend="bold underline">while I went to Carissima's<persName xml:id="76"></persName> room, and read Mattins with her</hi> <hi rend="bold">.</hi></p>
         <p>In the afternoon I took my Americans &amp; Yvonne into Durham for the Cathedral service. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> also came with me. We found a "Church Parade" of Buffaloes in progress, a beery rather dissolute&#8211;looking crowd in some kind of "regalia". The Dean<persName xml:id="114"></persName> preached a highly characteristic sermon from the words, "<hi rend="underline">What mean ye by this service</hi>?" It was a series of topical allusions strung together on the frame&#8211;work of the initials of the Society, R.A.O.B., which he made to stand for Religion, Amiability, Order, Benevolence. Once or twice the congregation was moved to "applause and laughter". The Bishop of S. Florida and I went into the Deanery for tea, while Ella took the ladies into the Cruickshanks<persName xml:id="1898"><persName xml:id="2663"></persName></persName>. There we joined them, and, after walking through the Banks, returned to Auckland. </p>
