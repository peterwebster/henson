         <p><hi rend="italic">A wet morning, infinitely gloomy.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">Our American guests went away after an early breakfast</hi> <hi rend="italic">, (which, to my chagrin, hindered our prayers in chapel), and their departure induced a great sense of peace!</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">Why is it that the voice, phrase, manner, and carriage of American women are so disturbing?</hi> <hi rend="italic">The Bishop is very superior to his women&#8211;kind, a circumstance said to be common in legal and ecclesiastical spheres, where men often rise into power or prominence from obscure &amp; limited situations, and carry into life the refining &amp; educating influences of their profession; but where their wives perpetuate the crudities of their original ? In all this, I suspect that little justice is done to the self&#8211;sacrifice and even ^ to the hard work of the gentler sex. </hi></p>
         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Darling &amp; his daughter and I motored into Durham. We visited the Castle, and were shown round: then we went to the Cathedral, and made a rapid circuit. We lunched at the Deanery, and then Mead Falkner<persName xml:id="3553"></persName> showed my guests the treasures of the Chapter Library, while I transacted business with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>. I went to Andrews, &amp; ordered a supply of stationary. Then we motored back in time for tea at the Castle.</p>
         <p>I walked for an hour with Darling in the Park before dinner. He talked most interestingly all the time. His talk would have deserved record, but I cannot recall it!</p>
