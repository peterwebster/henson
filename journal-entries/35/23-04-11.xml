         <p>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> appeared with the car outside the hotel and Newcastle Station about 9 a.m., and carried me to Auckland, where I had a bath, &amp; went through the letters with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>. Then we motored to Durham, where I instituted three curates, and lunched with Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>.
