         <p>Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> went away for a week's holiday. William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> motored me to Stockton, where I "visited" that Rural Deanery. At 10.15 a.m. I addressed the clergy in Church: and at 11.15.a.m. spoke to them at length on the subject of "The Marriage Law". In the afternoon I attended a garden party given by Lady Sadler: and at 7 p.m. I addressed a large meeting of Parochial Church Councillors, on "Prayer Book Revision". The "Anglo Catholick" crank Milner was impertinent, &amp; there were a few others of this type: but mostly it was an enthusiastic and well&#8211;behaved meeting. Afterwards I returned to Auckland arriving about 9.45 p.m. The weather became fine, &amp; much warmer in the course of the day. </p>
