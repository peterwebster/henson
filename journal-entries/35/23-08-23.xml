         <p>I had some talk with Burge about the situation in the church. He is quite as much at a loss for a policy as I am, though I suspect that he still clings to the notion that the way of escape may be found in the futile method of conferences. I pointed out that an indispensible condition of any conference that could be effective, must be a preliminary understanding that everybody would accept the results arrived at by the majority.</p>
         <p>About 2 p.m. rain began to fall, &amp; fell heavily for the rest of the day. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> with M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Burge motored to call on M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Rayner. I stayed in the house, &amp; talked with the Bishop &amp; Allen, the Principal of S. Edmond Hall.</p>
         <p>I read rapidly through <hi rend="doubleunderline">Father Woodlock's</hi> "<hi rend="underline">Constantinople, Canterbury, &amp; Rome'</hi>. It is a reply to <hi rend="doubleunderline">Gore's</hi><persName xml:id="49"></persName> lecture on '<hi rend="underline">Catholicism &amp; Roman Catholicism'</hi>, &amp;, though rather rudely expressed, is effective.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir John Simon</hi><persName xml:id="1008"></persName> &amp; Lady Simon, together with M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> John Murray came to dinner. He looked well, &amp; was in excellent spirits. His wife is evidently devoted to him, but she is noisy &amp; unsuitable. However in these matters one man may not see with the eyes of another. <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi> <hi rend="bold superscript doubleunderline">r</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline"> John Murray</hi> is a member for one of the constituencies in Leeds. He spoke sensibly, if somewhat cynically, about the political situation. <hi rend="bold underline">He thinks France will first edge us out of the continent, &amp; then give easy terms to Germany on the understanding that she enter a continental combination against us!</hi></p>
