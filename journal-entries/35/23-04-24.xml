         <p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, April 24</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1923.</hi></p>
         <p>I attended a meeting of the Patronage Committee at 10.30 a.m. We spent most of the morning in hearing the evidence of <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline"> Justice Sankey</hi><persName xml:id="3403"></persName> on the system adopted by the disestablished Church of Wales. It was interesting and wellâ€“given, but had little bearing on the problem of patronage in England. Then, when the Judge had departed, we found ourselves without any business to do: and, to my chagrin, I learned that I might well have postponed my coming to London until Thursday. This is bad chairmanship.</p>
         <p>I lunched at the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> with the Dean of York, who has just been elected a member of the Club under the special rule. Then I went to the House of Lords, where I found the Bishop of Bristol. We had tea together before going in to the House. I found that Lord Balfour of Burleigh was raising the question of publishing reports of Divorce Trials, <hi rend="bold underline">and I was moved to make a short speech</hi> <hi rend="bold">.</hi> It was brief and ineffective. Evidently the general feeling of the House was in favour of restrictive legislation.</p>
         <p>I called in Victoria Street and saw Marion<persName xml:id="77"></persName> before going to 'The Club'<orgName xml:id="328"></orgName> to dine. It was a pleasant party of six, viz: Lord Hugh Cecil<persName xml:id="314"></persName>, Sir Frederick Kenyon, Bailey, Sir Henry Newbolt, Sir Charles Oman<persName xml:id="2141"></persName>, and the Bishop of Durham. Oman &amp; I walked back together as far as Westminster, when he went to the House and I to my lodging.</p>
