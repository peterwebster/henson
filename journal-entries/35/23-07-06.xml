         <p>The temperature reached 84<hi rend="superscript underline">o </hi>in the shade today. There was in the <hi rend="underline">"Times"</hi> a short letter from John Bailey, answering Pollard. But I thought it necessary to write also myself as Pollard's "friendly questions" had been addressed directly to me. Accordingly I walked to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and there composed an epistle which, as Bernard happened to be in the Club, I showed to him, and, when he approved it, I posted it to Printing House Square. In the afternoon I walked to Westminster, and went into the Library of the House of Lords, where I wrote to Carissima<persName xml:id="76"></persName>. The heat was so great that I abandoned my purpose of making calls, and returned to the Club, where I found divers acquaintances. I walked back to the Deanery and there dined. The Bishop of Carlisle &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs </hi>Williams had arrived. The three ladies having gone to the Coliseum, Ralph<persName xml:id="427"></persName>, Carlisle &amp; I talked large until their return.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">A telegram from Birchington informed us that there was to be a consultation of the doctors about Marion's<persName xml:id="77"></persName> case tonight.</hi></p>
         <p>The dock strike is still spreading in spite of the efforts of the Union leaders. There is said to be an active Communist agitation in progress among the men who are completely out of hand. Probably the great &amp; sudden heat makes work more than commonly disgusting.</p>
