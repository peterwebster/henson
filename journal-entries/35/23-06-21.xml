         <p>The "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>" publishes the letter I wrote on Tuesday, adding as a title "<hi rend="underline">Bishop of Durham's Warning</hi>". It fills rather more than a column, &amp; reads rather fiercely. But, perhaps on that account, it may succeed in arresting attention. I shall be more than ever supposed to be a hard persecutor, a kind of <hi rend="underline">Bonner redivivus</hi>!</p>
         <p>I spent the morning in trying to prepare a sermon for York Minster. My text, "<hi rend="underline">Shall two walk together except they have agreed</hi>?" lends itself to an ecclesiastical application, which, as the National Assembly meets in the days following, I propose to make.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, the weather, having become warm, I played bowls with William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>: &amp; then returned to my sermon.</p>
