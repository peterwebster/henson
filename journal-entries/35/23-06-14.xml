         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in the parish church at 8.45 a.m. About 30 clergy communicated. At 10.45 a.m. they assembled again in the Church for the Litany and a devotional address. <hi rend="bold underline">Then followed in the Institute the discussion of the Marriage Law</hi>. Then lunch in the Institute. In the afternoon I motored into Newcastle, and had my hair cut ; then I was taken to see the Cottage Hospital which has been established in the Rectory as the War memorial for Whickham. <hi rend="bold underline">At 7 p.m. I addressed about 500 parochial church councillors in the parish hall, &amp; then returned to Auckland.</hi></p>
