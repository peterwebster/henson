         <p>What is the province of the laity? To hunt, to shoot, to entertain. These matters they understand, but to meddle with ecclesiastical matters they have no right at all.</p>

         <p>Thus brutally expressed the clerical view of the layman remains always the same. In this respect at least the Roman and the Anglican are agreed.</p>
         <p>I spent the morning in writing the first of the 2 articles which I had promised to write for the "<hi rend="underline">Morning Post</hi>" on the Anglo&#8211;Catholic Congress. It was sent off by the evening post.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon <hi rend="doubleunderline">Macdonald</hi><persName xml:id="3698"></persName> brought a party of 50 unemployed men from West Hartlepool. They had tea in the gallery, and attended a short service in the Chapel. I showed them the State Room, etc., and let them play bowls in the garden. They seemed to enjoy themselves.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">Charlie Oman</hi><persName xml:id="1679"></persName> arrived for a short visit. He is awaiting his <hi rend="underline">viv&#x00E2; voce</hi> examination in the final history school. A silent leisurely youth with archaeological tastes, &amp; a sweet temper.</p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><persName xml:id="4501"></persName> completes four years in my service today. I gave him a copy of '<hi rend="underline">Nicholas Nickleby</hi>' to mark the fact.</p>
         <p>The weather was rainy &amp; chill.</p>
