         <p>I left the castle about 9 p.m. and motored to Sunderland, picking up Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> in Durham on the way. At 10.30 a.m. the new vicar, a rather gloomy fellow called Baily, was instituted and inducted as Vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Ignatius. I preached, instituted and celebrated. Goldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>, the Rural Dean, acted as the Archdeacon's deputy in the induction. There were many communicants, &amp; the service was choral. Thus we had not finished before 1 p.m. , which left little time for Wilson and me to get back to Durham for lunch. However William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> drove at a smart pace, reaching as much as (publish it not in Gath) 42 miles per hour! After a hasty lunch with Wilson, William motored me to Newcastle where I preached to a great gathering of Freemasons in the Brunswick Chapel. After this function we returned to Auckland where we arrived about 5.20 p.m. </p>
         <p>I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, to George Nimmins<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, to Colin Kennedy<persName xml:id="2432"></persName>, and to the new parson of S. Francis.</p>
