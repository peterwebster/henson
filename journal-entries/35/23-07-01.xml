         <p>I went with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> to the Cathedral at 8 a.m., and received the Holy Communion in the Lady Chapel. The vast Eastern window, illuminated by a bright sun, was almost overpowering brilliant. </p>
         <p>At 10.30 a.m., I preached in the Choir to a large and very attentive congregation. My text was Amos iii.3 "<hi rend="underline">Shall two walk together except they have agreed</hi>?", and my subject was the necessity of restoring fundamental harmony to the Church of England at all costs. </p>
         <p>We were taken to lunch at a noble Elizabethan House, Heslington Hall, the seat of Lord Deramore. There was a pleasant party at luncheon. We returned to the Deanery in time for Evensong in the Minster at 4 p.m. The singing was excellent, better than I had expected. </p>
