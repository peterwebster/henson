         <p><hi>I worked most part of the day at the All Souls Sermon, but made strangely little progress.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I received a letter from Gilbert Simpson<persName xml:id="554"></persName> announcing the birth of his son</hi><hi>, &amp; asking me to be the boy's Godfather. This request I refused as I am barred by my "spiritual affinity" to Gilbert himself. It would hardly be permitted by the canons that the same man should be Godfather of a father and a son! The Chancellor of the Exchequer<persName xml:id="343"></persName> made a surprisingly optimistic speech in the House last night. He even said that he saw no necessity for additional taxation next year. But this seems too good to be true.</hi></p>
