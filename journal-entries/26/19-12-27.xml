         <p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, December 27</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1919.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I wrote to Dicey<persName xml:id="403"></persName>, and to Clarence Stock<persName xml:id="1178"></persName>, who announces to me his engagement to be married. Both he and the young lady are convinced eugenists, and their plans are calculated on eugenic principles in rather a cold&#8211;blooded fashion!</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I called on M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Emmett<persName xml:id="5083"></persName>, the late Vicar of Walford&#8211;On&#8211;Wye, who has brought himself a house opposite the late Mayor's house. We talked of dogs and horses!</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Carnegy<persName xml:id="4525"></persName>, the Vicar of Ledbury wrote to tell me that M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Morrison of Bridgenorth had contributed &#x00A3;1000 to the Poor Benefices Augmentation Fund of which he is Secretary. I sent a note of thanks to the lady.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Bannister<persName xml:id="3619"></persName> sent me a copy of the "Church Times" for Dec: 19</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline">: It contains a correspondence between the Abp. of C.<persName xml:id="128"></persName> and the Bp. of Zanzibar<persName xml:id="3469"></persName>. He wished to make a protest against my presence in the Lambeth Conference<orgName xml:id="114"></orgName>, &amp; stated that he w</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> be unable to receive the Holy Com</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">n</hi><hi rend="bold underline">. "side by side with a bishop who claims ability to correct his teachings". The Ab</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">p</hi><hi rend="bold underline">. explains that the Lambeth Conference is neither a council nor a synod.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> came for his preparation. We went on with the Creed and went as far as "the holy Catholic Church".</hi></p>
