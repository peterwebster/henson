         <p><hi>You are very kind to ask me to preach in the Abbey, and, of course, I perceive and value the "oliveâ€“branch" which is wrapped up in any friendly proposal from the Founder of the Life and Liberty movement to the Outcast of Hereford. But I must "find my feet" in the new situation which has been created before I can see my way usefully to accept any invitation which might fairly be interpreted as acceptance, or (forgive me) condonation.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>With kind regards to your wife.</hi></p>
