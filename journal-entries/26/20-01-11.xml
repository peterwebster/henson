         <p><hi>The warm weather continues, and in view of the coal shortage we must be thankful for it. I went to the cathedral and celebrated at 8 a.m. After breakfast I revised my notes for an extemporaneous sermon at Canon Pyon from Rom: XII.I "</hi><hi rend="underline">I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service</hi><hi>." In a hurricane of wind and rain I motored to the parish, &amp; preached to about two score people. Afterwards I had some talk with the churchwardens in the vicarage, and was assured that the parish was admirably worked, &amp; would resent nothing so much as the eviction of their beloved vicar!! I also had some talk with the vicar's wife, on whom I urged the duty of her husband's resignation. She said that he had decided to resign, but had not fixed the date.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I preached at Evensong in S. Nicholas's Church â€“ a structure of which the hideousness is almost incapacitating for worship. It has no redeeming utilities, for its acoustics are bad, and its arrangement by no means convenient. Wynne&#8211;Willson's<persName xml:id="4448"></persName> boys, Jack &amp; Sandy, escorted me home.</hi></p>
