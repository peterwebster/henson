         <p><hi>I worked steadily at the article but with ill success. The truth is that my pace is getting slower, and I want much more time for "shaking down" my material in my mind, &amp; fixing on my manner of attacking the subject. Moreover in this particular case there are a number of new books which ought to be read &amp; digested. Accordingly, I find this "hand to mouth" manner of writing in the intervals of all the important futilities that make up what is called 'diocesan administration' is extremely unsatisfactory. I cannot doubt that the outcome will be equally disappointing.</hi></p>
         <p><hi><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went to a concert in the Shire Hall, and I seized the opportunity of a long evening to write the article which I too rashly promised for the "Review of the Reviews" on the stupid &amp; exasperating subject, "Prohibition". I make my position unnecessarily difficult with all the sectaries who are equally baffled and scandalised by the spectacle of a Christian minister who is not a total abstainer, &amp; who does not hail the closing of public houses as the formal inauguration of the Kingdom of Heaven!</hi></p>
