         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The post brought the "Edinburgh" with my article on 'The Church &amp; Socialism'.</hi> <hi>It has the place of honour in the number.

He says that the Articles were put forth 'partly to declare that consent &amp; harmony which was betwixt them (the Anglicans) and the rest of those National Churches which had made an open separation from the Popes of Rome'. It was local dissidence that the Anglican found intolerable, not divergence of polity. And on this point he found himself in agreement with the Protestant &amp; Reformed churches everywhere.</hi></p>
