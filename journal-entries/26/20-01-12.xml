         <p><hi>I wrote to Abp S&#x00F6;derblom<persName xml:id="2166"></persName>, to Professor Bacon<persName xml:id="3057"></persName>, and to J. G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName>. Also I returned the page proofs to the Press. I called on James<persName xml:id="4292"></persName>, &amp; instructed him to give &#x00A3;10 to old Croft, as a present from me: and I paid &#x00A3;7.4.0 for my taxes.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>After lunch Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> &amp; I worked at sawing wood, as the rain made a walk uninviting.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I read Bp. Wordworth's<persName xml:id="1554"></persName> Hale Lectures on "The National Church of Sweden" with the notion in my mind of drawing a parallel between the Reformation in Sweden and in England. There is a rather remarkable resemblance but, perhaps, the difference is even more remarkable. Gustaf Vasa<persName xml:id="5122"></persName> had many points in common with Henry VIII, but there were at least 3 important differences. 1. He was not a theologian. 2. He was, so far as he has had any definite personal convictions, a Reformer. 3. He had no personal quarrel with the Papacy. Cranmer<persName xml:id="1838"></persName> was more than Laurentius Petri<persName xml:id="5110"></persName>. He added the qualities of Olaus Petri<persName xml:id="5111"></persName>. There was never in England any such dominating influence as that which in Sweden was exercised by German Lutheranism. The foreign influence was intermittent and secondary.</hi></p>
