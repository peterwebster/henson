         <p><hi>I went to the cathedral and celebrated the Holy Communion. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> walked with me to Holy Trinity where I preached on "Temperance" taking as my text S. Paul's words in I.Cor:VI </hi><hi rend="underline">"Glorify God, therefore, in your body".</hi><hi> I spoke frankly about Prohibition, &amp; condemned it as a policy which could not be reconciled with the principles of the Gospel. After lunch I wrote to George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, and also to Kathleen<persName xml:id="2658"></persName>. Later I went to </hi><hi rend="bold underline">S</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Nicholas for Evensong and there read from the chancel step the King's letter about next Tuesday's commemoration and then preached on the 'League of Nations'.</hi><hi> The church was well&#8211;filled, and the newly formed band of Boy scouts received me at the door. It is, I suppose, something to be thankful for that the people are sufficiently anxious to hear me so that when I am announced to preach the congregation is swollen by the influx of strangers. This, in turn, increases the amount of the collection, &amp; therefore pleases both parson &amp; churchwardens, who perceive some advantage in a visit from the diocesan! And the Bishop becomes in this way known by sight to the lay&#8211;people.</hi></p>
