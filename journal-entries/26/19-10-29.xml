         <p><hi>A dismally wet day very congruous with a rather dolorous function â€“ the meeting for business only of the Diocesan Conference. About 60 members attended in the Town Hall. I made a short speech, and then got on to the business which was transacted in 2 hours without any incident. There can be no doubt that the heart has gone out of Church work in this diocese. Mainly I think the cause is anxiety, financial &amp; social. Nobody knows what is coming, but everybody has a feeling of impending disaster. Nothing any more seems worth while attempting.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">War&#8211;memorials are rending some of the rural parishes into fragments</hi><hi>. The extreme unpopularity of the parsons accounts for something; the competing claims of bereaved families adds a specially difficult factor: discord about the form of the memorial, the inscription, the fees for the faculty completes the tragedy. On </hi><hi rend="underline">a priori</hi><hi> grounds it would naturally be concluded that all quarrelling would die out in front of a common desire to honour the departed heroes; but in fact it is far otherwise. The squalidest disputes gather about the monuments of the Brave!</hi></p>
