         <p><hi rend="italic">I went to the club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, wrote letters, &amp; lunched. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Firth</hi><hi rend="italic"> joined me at lunch. He looks rather worne &amp; aged. I said that I had expected to see him enter the lists in defence of S. R.

He said that there c</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> be no reasonable question as to that historian's absolute integrity, but his method was fairly open to criticism. Then I went to Paddington, &amp; caught the train to Hereford.

I had some conversation with him after dinner, but not wholly to my content. There is no getting away from the fact that </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">these societies undercut diocesan authority, and place a potent instrument for fashioning opinion in the hands of the governing clique at the centre</hi><hi rend="italic">. The Bishop is treated with a mighty parade of dutiful deference, but he has no real control of the movement which takes its orders from an external authority, &amp; pursues ends of its own. </hi></p>
