         <p><hi>I read through </hi><hi rend="underline">Hooker's</hi><persName xml:id="969"></persName><hi> Preface to the Eccl. Polity. It is remarkable how clearly he perceived the incompatibility of the presbyterian system with popular liberty. Calvin's<persName xml:id="930"></persName> desire to protect religion from the instability of popular rule was, he suggests, the original motive &amp; sufficient apology for his experiment. Hooker's analysis of the agitation by which the Genevan system was advocated far and wide is extraordinarily acute and true. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">It has been illustrated very strikingly by the "Life and Liberty" agitators.</hi><hi rend="bold"></hi><hi>His comments on the prominent part played by women is very noteworthy. They also are quite relevant to any just criticism of our latest agitation. In all this, Hooker is no more of the 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century than of the 20</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>: he writes of that which changes not â€“ human nature, its ardours &amp; follies, its blindness &amp; sin.</hi></p>
