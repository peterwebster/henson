         <p><hi>At 9.45 a.m. I left the Castle, taking with me in the car Fearne Booker<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> &amp; Barbara Lilley, whom we dropped at Durham where they were bent on visiting the buildings, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Carey Bonner, whom we left at the Newcastle station, Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>, and James, who was visiting his home. Clayton and I went to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, (of which as successor to the Founder, Bishop Butler, I am "Grand Visitor") and there I dedicated a memorial tablet on which were inscribed the names of 20 members of the staff, who had fallen in the War. Lord Armstrong read the Lesson, D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Drummond read the names &amp; unveiled the monument. I dedicated it, &amp; preached a short sermon. The Lord Mayor of Newcastle was present, &amp; seemed much affected by what I said. He begged me to give him my notes. Photographers "snapped" me several times over! From the Infirmary we went to </hi><hi rend="bold underline">the Gateshead Rectory</hi><hi>, &amp; lunched with Stephenson. After lunch Clayton and I went through the morning's letters. Then we walked to Christ Church, where I took part in a parish reception: at which there was a rally of old incumbents &amp; curates to mark the "jubilee" of the Church. I made a short speech. An old man in moving a vote of thanks to me reviewed the careers &amp; characters of the Bishops of Durham from Villiers to myself! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He described me a "the Lloyd George of the Church", &amp; announced my impending translation to Canterbury! This is a perilous kind of fooling</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi>After "high tea" in Christ Church Vicarage, we attended Evensong in the church. There was a considerable congregation but by no means a crowded church. I preached an old sermon on "the parish church", originally composed for a dedication Festival in East Ham. The service ended, we motored back to the Castle, arriving a few minutes before 10 p.m. I was surprized and in a measure distressed to observe so few men in the congregation at Christ Church. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Davison</hi><hi> is a really able &amp; well&#8211;read man: he has the reputation of being an unusually good preacher: &amp; he appears to be deservedly popular in his parish. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Yet he has no more power to draw the young men to church than the veriest nincompoops of ritualism</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
