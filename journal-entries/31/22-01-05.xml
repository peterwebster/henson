         <p><hi>I packed my bag, and left Park Lane. Leaving the bag at the Club, I went on to Westminster, and attended the Committee until 3.45 p.m., lunching at the Club. I caught the 5.30 p.m. express at King's Cross, and travelled comfortably, save for the cold, to Darlington where William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> met me with the car. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I relieved the journey by reading Raleigh's<persName xml:id="14"></persName> "Annals of the Church of Scotland", which deals with John Knox admirably</hi><hi>. I suspect that the </hi><hi rend="underline">amour propre</hi><hi> of the Scots will be wounded by such candid handling of "the Apostle of Scotland".

Before going to bed I signed a large number of labels for prizes in a "Walter Scott competition" in Edinburgh. This duty attached to my office as President of the Walter Scott Association.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
