         <p><hi>There was snow on the ground, and later a brilliantly fine day. Yielding to my weakness, I decided to shirk my duties, and charged Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> with letters of apology. Then I lay in bed until lunch&#8211;time, and read Lockhart's "Life". After lunch I remained in my study dozing &amp; reading, both futile. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote another section of William's<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> Birthday Letter</hi><hi>, and had much talk with Lilley. So the day slipped away.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I had for some weeks been looking forward to the engagements of this Sunday with apprehension because they took me to ill&#8211;conditioned parishes and unpleasant parsons. But at the last moment another Factor intervenes, which I had not admitted into my calculations, and the whole series of undertakings is suddenly cancelled. That Factor – the failure of my physique – is likely to intervene ever more frequently as the years pass. In any case, it is certainly not wisely to be omitted from my plans in the future.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
