         <p><hi>I left Birchington by the "City Express" at 8.15 a.m, &amp; reached Cannon Street at 10 a.m. It was pouring with rain in London. I went to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; occupied myself there until 12.30 p.m. when I lunched on the worst cold mutton I have chanced on for many a long day. Then I went to King's Cross, &amp; took the 1.40 p.m. train to the North. There was a delay of 35 minutes at Northallerton owing to the breaking of a coupling. At Darlington I was met by Gilbert Darwin<persName xml:id="3981"></persName>, who had been visiting the Castle, and had returned in the car with William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName>. On my arrival I found that Kathleen<persName xml:id="2658"></persName> had arrived from Edinburgh, and Archdeacon &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Lilley had come from Carlisle.</hi></p>
