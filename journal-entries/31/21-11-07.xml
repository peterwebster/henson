         <p><hi>Another very cold but brilliant day. Rather reluctantly, for I am still far from well, I resolved to accompany Lilley to Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring, before attending a meeting of the Bede College Committee in the afternoon. We left the castle at 11 a.m., and in less than an hour were at the Rectory where we found Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> expecting us. The little man is telling effectively on his difficult parish, and I think that the clergy are perceiving that in him they have a Rural Dean who means business. Indeed, he seems to be fitting in to his position so successfully that I should hesitate to move him, if the opportunity arrived. After an early lunch with the Knights, we motored to Durham where I presided over a meeting of the Bede Committee, while Lilley went to service in the cathedral. We returned home directly after service, for I stupidly forgot that I was pledged to take tea at S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Chad's, &amp; interview an Ordination candidate. I sent a note to Bickmore telling him that I could not preside, as I had promised, at the C.M.S.<orgName xml:id="124"></orgName> meeting tonight. I received "birthday letters" from Godfrey, Lord Charnwood<persName xml:id="2685"></persName>, &amp; from the Mayor of Sunderland. The weather has become very cold. As we motored homewards, the red setting sun, very resplendent, seemed to proclaim the advent of WINTER.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
