         <p><hi>I return herewith the design for the Durham War Memorial and thank the Memorial Committee for their courtesy in letting me see it. In view of the fact that "the design has been accepted by the Committee without the Canopy", it is obvious that any opinion on my part would now be superfluous, and might fairly be resented: but I may, perhaps, without impropriety confess my apprehension as to the appearance of the unprotected monument after it has been exposed for some years to our northern climate: Nor will I conceal the fact that I am not quite happy about leaving a recumbent effigy naked to the elements. </hi></p>
         <p><hi>Believe me, Yours v. sincerely,</hi></p>

         <p><hi>Dear M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Wallis,</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I have to acknowledge your letter of the 14</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> inst. conveying a resolution of the Council of the Durham Colleges, which it gave me very great pleasure to receive. The support of the Council is doubly welcome to me, not only for its direct value which is considerable, but also for the evidence of friendship between the Council and myself, which it provides.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>Believe me, sincerely yours,</hi></p>

         <p><hi>My Lord Bishop,</hi></p>
         <p><hi>At a meeting of the Durham Colleges in the University of Durham the following resolution was moved by the President &amp; passed by the Council:</hi></p>

         <p><hi rend="italic">Sir,</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">I have to acknowledge your letter of the 11</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> February, in which you convey to me the request of the Committee of "an Anglo&#8211;Catholic Congress for the North of England" that I should become a Vice&#8211;President of the said Congress, &amp; should if possible attend some of its meetings in that character. You are good enough to explain to me that "the aim of the Congress is that of the great Congress in London in 1920 viz: the Conversion to our Lord of those who do not know him", and you express the hope that my 'sympathy &amp; prayers' will be given to the Congress. </hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">It needs no saying that from such an aim no genuinely Christian man could withhold his sympathy and prayers. Certainly nothing could be nearer my heart than "the Conversion to our Lord of those who do not know Him." I should count it the highest of privileges if in any effective manner I could assist personally in that great adventure.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Nevertheless, I apprehend that something more than this is properly requisite before I could, as Bishop of Durham, rightly associate myself with the proposed Anglo&#8211;Catholic Congress. I must have satisfied myself that the object which I approve will be pursued by methods which are not merely sound in themselves but also consist with the principles &amp; established disciplines of the Church of England. I cannot honourably add my name to the number of the Vice&#8211;Presidents of your Congress, if I am persuaded that your Congress is advocating a version of Christ's Religion which it is impossible to harmonize with the doctrine and discipline of the English Church.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">A careful and repeated perusal of the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Report of the first Anglo&#8211;Catholic Congress</hi><hi rend="italic">" – to which in your letter you refer me – has convinced me that the newly&#8211;organized 'Anglo&#8211;Catholic' movement is (save for some reserves as to the extent of the Papal Authority, and an unavoidable dissent from the Papal condemnation of Anglican Orders) in principle and tendency not Anglican, or Catholic, but Roman.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">I will not burden my letter by stating my reasons for this conclusion, nor is it needful that I should do so, since I have done so sufficiently in the Preface to my recently published volume on "Anglicanism".</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">While, therefore, I must needs applaud the pious zeal of your </hi><hi rend="i bold">[150] </hi><hi rend="italic">Committee, and still pray that God's Blessing may rest on every honest effort, however shadowed by error, to win men to their true allegiance, I cannot feel myself free in conscience to comply with the request which your Committee has made.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">As Bishop of Durham, holding that great office under the solemn pledges given at my consecration to the Episcopate, I cannot rightly or honourably allow it to be thought that I can reconcile the general conception of Christ's Religion disclosed in the Report of the Anglo&#8211;Catholic Congress held in London in 1920 with that which finds expression in the history, law, &amp; established formularies of the Church of England.</hi></p>

         </div>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">I sent a copy of this letter to the "Times". It will, perhaps, be resented by the Bishops who have already accepted the Anglo&#8211;Catholic</hi><hi rend="italic"> invitation, but, I fear, this is unavoidable. If I am to associate myself with evangelistic efforts, designed and carried through on "Catholic" lines, and leading to "Catholic" objectives, I had better declare myself a "Catholic", and garner the harvest of adulation which that performance would assuredly bring.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Vicar&#8211;designate of Bishop Auckland, the Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> Adolphus Benjamin Parry&#8211;Evans<persName xml:id="5414"></persName>, B.A. (London), A.K.C. and his wife, have been staying here, and, today, have given themselves up to the task of inspecting their new sphere of life &amp; work. Last night they met their predecessor at dinner: &amp; today, they have lunched at the Vicarage, &amp; been shewn over the parish. Every ecclesiastical appointment is a leap in the dark. We can but hope for the best, &amp; believe in the governing Providence which we serve when, in good faith &amp; without any purpose but that of doing right, we take our course. I </hi><hi rend="italic underline">wish</hi><hi rend="italic"> the new Vicar were an Oxford or a Cambridge man, but after 3 unsuccessful attempts – Barry, Gordon, &amp; the Southend man all for various reasons, &amp; all reluctantly having declined my offer – there was not much liberty left to me.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
