         <p><hi rend="italic">I attended the session in the Town Hall at which the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Industrial Question</hi><hi rend="italic"> was discussed. The appointed speakers were mostly socialists, &amp; the "discussion" was extraordinarily feeble. I did not speak, though several private appeals were made to me. But I only wished to take the measure of the madness. For the first time I saw the redoubtable </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Tawney</hi><hi rend="italic">. He is a stout man with a superior &amp; very "cock&#8211;sure" manner, &amp; the carriage of a revolutionary. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Raven</hi><hi rend="italic"> looking very overwraught </hi><hi>[sic] </hi><hi rend="italic">&amp; apocalyptic, spoke well but, of course, extravagantly. The </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Warden of Liddon House</hi><hi rend="italic">, a parson named Slessor, was on the same side. </hi><hi>There was a sensible speech by a man named Blain. The general effect was highly mischievous. Particularly I was interested in the audience, which had a very bald&#8211;headed &amp; grey haired appearance, &amp; was clearly hotly sympathetic with the Socialists. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Waggett</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">spoke to me after the meeting. He looks but a little changed since the time, more than 30 years ago, when he tried to persuade me to imitate his example, and join the Cowley Brotherhood. </hi><hi>I came away by the 2.20 p.m. train from New Street Station. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Linetta</hi><persName xml:id="1255"></persName><hi> came on to the platform to see me off. I think she is pleased with her professorship. I arrived at Darlington at 7.22 p.m., and was met by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">William</hi><persName xml:id="4501"></persName><hi> &amp; the car. After dinner </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Clayton</hi><persName xml:id="5074"></persName><hi> &amp; I went through the correspondence.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
