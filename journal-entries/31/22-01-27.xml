         <p><hi>Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> and I went into Durham by the 9.21 train, &amp; proceeded at once to the Deanery, where I had the advantage of warning Welldon<persName xml:id="114"></persName> in advance that I intended to speak about the future of the cathedral. He expressed himself in hearty approval of my ideas. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the cathedral which was nearly empty: but the must was wonderful. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I wish that the "Catholick" scruples of the devout on the subject of fasting Communion could be sometimes laid aside so that a genuinely corporate Communion were possible</hi><hi>. I lunched at the Deanery, where a number of the hon: canons and their wives were also lunching. At 2.30 p.m. the Commemoration Service took place. There was but a scanty congregation, which, perhaps, the inclement weather sufficiently explained. The Dean read the Commemoration Form from the Lectern, and I preached the sermon that I had prepared. I gave the Benediction from the Throne. After having tea with the Cruickshanks<persName xml:id="1898"></persName>, I went to Sunderland, &amp; was met at the station there by Gouldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>. I dedicated a War&#8211;Memorial in Bishopwearmouth Parish Church, and preached the sermon. Then I returned to the Rectory, &amp; stayed the night there. The weather was quite execrable, deluges of rain: but it is clearing away the snow.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
