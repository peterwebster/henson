         <p><hi>Rain fell without intermission all day, and had effect in reducing the attendance at the Diocesan Conference. However a fair number of clergy &amp; laity came together in the chapter&#8211;house. After attending mattins in the Cathedral, I presided at the Conference, which, with an interval for lunch sate from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. My address was listened to closely, and applauded at the end. The motion approving the appointment of a lay secretary to the Finance Board at a stipend of &#x00A3;400 per annum was carried without difficulty, and then </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rashdall</hi><persName xml:id="117"></persName><hi> read his paper on ecclesiastical courts. He was well received, &amp; well listened to, though his delivery is so bad that I doubt whether many of the company could hear his paper. After lunching at the Deanery, the Conference resumed. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Moulsdate</hi><hi> read a paper which was clever but shallow &amp; unscrupulous. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I made some observations which were well received by the Conference</hi><hi>. Then Knowlden<persName xml:id="5439"></persName> brought forward the question of Divorce. He was supported by Miers in a vulgar windy speech. After some remarks from me the motion was withdrawn. I had tea in the Deanery, &amp; </hi><hi rend="bold">[11]</hi><hi> sate there until it was time to go to the Johnston School, where I had undertaken to unveil a memorial. There was a gathering of parents &amp; "old boys". The little function was quite unusually impressive, &amp;, indeed, became so evidently a religious service that I concluded it with the Benediction. Then we motored back to Durham through a hurricane &amp; torrents of rain. At one point our advance was almost hindered by a tree that had been blown down. The Rashdalls and Miss Higson left the Castle.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
