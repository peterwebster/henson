         <p><hi>I motored into Durham, &amp; attended the funeral service in the Cathedral of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Morant, the Chief Constable's wife, whose sudden death came as a painful surprise to many of us. I returned to the Castle for lunch, and afterwards presided over a numerous meeting of the supporters of our Preventive &amp; Rescue Work, to which Miss Higson addressed a very sane &amp; persuasive speech. More than 200 people came, &amp; were given tea after a short service in the chapel at which the "Women's Offering" was presented. The ill effect of the great strike is shown in the reduction of the amount by no less than &#x00A3;160. Later I motored with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName> to Spennymoor, and dedicated a War memorial. There was a crowded congregation largely composed of relatives in deep mourning. The rain fell heavily during the afternoon and evening.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
