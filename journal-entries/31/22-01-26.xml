         <p><hi>I spent the morning in revising the address for tonight, and the sermon for tomorrow. Of the latter I made a considerable transcript, and sent it to the Editor of the "Yorkshire Post", requesting that, in view of the practical importance of my suggestion for annexing more Durham canonries to professorships in the University, he should find room for it in his journal.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>The snow began to fall again after lunch, and though at first it melted, after awhile it began to settle, and when I returned to the Castle shortly after 11 p.m., there were several inches on the ground.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>I travelled to Middlesbrough, and gave an "Inaugural Address" in the Girls' High School on the occasion of the formation of a branch of the Historical Association. A local Headmaster named Edwards was in the chair, and Rawson, one of the Fellows of All Souls, was on the platform.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
