He is evidently a "Free Catholic", and is announced to read a paper on "The significance of the Protestant Revolt against Ceremonial", at the forthcoming Conference of Free Catholics.

On returning to my study, I found a quaint pen&#8211;wiper with a little metal dachshund, accompanied by a letter from the Thurlow boys to the following effect:</hi></p>
