         <p><hi>I felt very fatigued, and made but poor progress with my work. The weather became warm &amp; languorous. In the morning I went through the correspondence with Clayton<persName xml:id="5074"></persName>, &amp; then prepared notes for the evening. We left the Castle at 5.15 p.m., and motored to Sunderland, stopping on the way at Burnmoon to arrange the date of the memorial dedication. We went to the Rectory &amp; picked up Gouldsmith<persName xml:id="1780"></persName>, who guided us to the stall, where the Parochial Church Councillors from the Deanery had assembled. There were about 400 of them. I addressed them on </hi><hi rend="bold underline">"Dangers &amp; Possibilities of Parochial Church Councils"</hi><hi>. After speaking for about half an hour, I sat down, and questions were asked by divers members of the audience. These did not occupy much time, and the meeting closed before 9 p.m. William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> was ready with the car, &amp; we returned to the Castle at the close of the meeting, arriving about 10.5 p.m.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
