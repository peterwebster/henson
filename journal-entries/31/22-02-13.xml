         <p><hi>No application for the Trinity Ordination in my letters! It seems fairly probable that there will be </hi><hi rend="underline">no</hi><hi> deacons ordained. We are surely "touching bottom" in this diocese. There have been several applications during the last few weeks from plainly impossible candidates – men who are middle&#8211;aged, illiterate, and of course married &amp; penniless – but none which falls within the diocesan regulations, or which could be accepted by any self&#8211;respecting bishop. This state of things is surely unparalleled in any other diocese. How far is the reason to be found in the unpopularity, or unwisdom, or reputed heretical leanings of the present Bishop of Durham?</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="doubleunderline">The Rev</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">J.E. Philipp's</hi><hi>, Vicar of Staindrop, came to see me. He desires leave of absence for six months or a whole year, on the score of health. He says that his curate is fully competent to carry on in his absence. I stipulated for a doctor's letter, &amp; a satisfactory assurance from the said curate, &amp;, these being found sufficient, promised to grant leave of absence from April 1</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi> to October 1</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi>.</hi></p>
         <p><hi>The </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">d </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">T. H. Hurrell</hi><hi>, Vicar of Hunwick, came to see me. He wants permission to effect an exchange with an Incumbent in the Carlisle diocese. I expounded my reasons for objecting to exchange except in very exceptional cases, among which his own could not be reckoned. He described himself as a "High Churchman", but not one of the new "Anglo&#8211;Catholicks". If Aglionby were to go to S. Cuthbert's Gateshead; why should not this man succeed him at the Ven</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">ble</hi><hi> Bede?</hi></p>
         <p><hi>At 5.30 p.m. I motored to Sunderland. William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> took the direct road through Houghton&#8211;le&#8211;Spring, but found it so villainously bad that he refused to return by it, preferring the longer route through Chester&#8211;le&#8211;Street. I addressed a meeting, which was said to be satisfactory in number &amp; quality, in advocacy of the Guild of Help, a local society of the nature of C.O.S. The mayor was in the chair. After the meeting we motored back to Auckland Castle. I sate with William, enjoying the fineness of the night &amp; the moon&#8211;lit landscape, and also having much pleasant talk with the boy. We reached the castle about 10 p.m. Aglionby sent me a note definitely declining S. Cuthbert's, Gateshead.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
