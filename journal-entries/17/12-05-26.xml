         <p>No communicants at all presented themselves at 7 a.m. â€“ an unprecedented &amp; unpromising beginning for the Festival.  At 8 a.m. there were but 51, a number which has only once been less during 12 years past.  At the Choral Eucharist 151 persons communicated, making a total of only 202, no less than 48 fewer than last year.</p>
         <p>I preached on the subject of the <ref xml:id="612">Festival at the Choral Eucharist</ref>, but wearily for the day waxed warm and sultry.</p>

         <p>At Evensong the congregation was good, though mainly composed of visitors.  I preached on <ref xml:id="611">'Spiritual Healing'</ref> with as much lucidity as I could command.  The attention was excellent.</p>
