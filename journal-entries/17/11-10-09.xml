         <p>The Chapter was fairly harmonious.  The 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> formally nominated me to be Sub–warden.  We appointed 2 sub–committees</p>
         <p>(α) 
<persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> &amp; I to consider the question of the stables: and</p>
         <p>(β) 
<persName xml:id="752">Barnett</persName> &amp; I to consider the question of transferring the wax effigies from the Islip chapel to the Norman Undercroft.</p>
         <p>I took possession of the Sub–dean's stall at Evensong.  The Anthem was helpful. "Thou shalt hear a voice behind thee saying, This is the way.  Walk ye in it".</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">
<persName xml:id="1135">Mitford Mitchell</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> dined with us.  They are in their several ways really good men.  Milford Mitchell was in the Abbey yesterday afternoon; &amp; seems to have been greatly pleased with my sermon.  Thus it is.  These old men – 
<persName xml:id="82">Marsden</persName> &amp; Mitford Mitchell – approve my preaching, but the younger men find nothing in it.  </hi>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">Surely it needs no more to prove that I am obsolete as the Rubrics, &amp; extinct as the Dodo!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I received a very melancholy letter from 
<persName xml:id="403">Dicey</persName>, referring to his own decease as a near event, and consulting me about arrangements.  
<persName xml:id="296">Duckworth's</persName> sudden death has clearly shocked his contemporaries.</p>
