         <p>The Holy Spirit of God, where it pleases Him to sow the seed of Grace, doth alter the very complexion &amp; nature of the soil, &amp; were our hearts as hard as flints, or as barren as the sand, he can make them as soft as wax, &amp; as fertile as Canaan, or the Paradise of God.  <hi rend="underline">Create a new heart within me</hi>, saith the Psalmist.

         <p>I celebrated in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's at 8 a.m.  There were 21 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Mattins had a 'holiday' aspect, and was not more than a third<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> the normal size.  I finished the course of sermons on 'Problems of Organized Christianity', &amp; begged for the 
<orgName xml:id="157">'Children's Country Holiday Fund'</orgName>.  The Offertory amounted to £32.19.6.</p>

         <p><hi rend="bold underline">At Evensong I preached on the <ref xml:id="609">Putumayo Atrocities</ref>, taking the Blue–book as my text–book. The congregation listened with very close attention</hi>.  The Offertory exceeded £14, bringing the total for the day to something over £47.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, the 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> July, I completed the correction of the proofs of <ref xml:id="83">"The Creed in the Pulpit"</ref> – which pleases me less at every page.  Then I walked into the City, &amp; saw the manager of the Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who told me that the volume would appear at the end of October.</p>
         <p>After lunch I had a most evil hour with the dentist.  Then 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to the Law Courts, &amp; had tea with the 
<persName xml:id="2187">Master of the Rolls</persName> in his room.  Afterwards he took us to the Record Office, &amp; showed us that most interesting building.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, 
<persName xml:id="1178" display="no">Clarence Stock</persName> came to visit us.  He is very full of the

         <p>On Friday, the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> August, we lunched with Bailward in his rooms in Victoria Street.</p>
