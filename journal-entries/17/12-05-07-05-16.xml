<hi rend="bold">Tuesday, May 7</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1912.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I attended service in chapel. 
<persName xml:id="1565"><hi rend="bold underline">Stokes</hi></persName> breakfasted with me in the Coffee Room. Then I returned to town by the 11 a.m. express. <hi rend="bold underline">
<persName xml:id="2558">Selbie</persName></hi>, the Principal of Mansfield, was in the carriage: we had some conversation on the Disestablishment question. Arrived in 
<placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, I found Ernest awaiting me. He went to work on the cuttings–register.</p>
         <p>I attended Evensong in the Abbey, when the service was arranged to commemorate the centenary of 
<persName xml:id="1348" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Browning's</hi></persName> birth. A special anthem composed by 
<persName xml:id="2559">Parry</persName> was sung.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Then I instructed </hi>
<persName xml:id="246"><hi rend="bold underline">Elizabeth Asquith</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> for an hour. The impudent child asked me whether I would like to be a bishop! This, when a bishoprick is actually vacant, though truly a most uninviting one. Poor

         </p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 11<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> May 1912, the 
<orgName xml:id="208" display="no">Welsh Conciliation Committee</orgName> met in the dining room, and agreed to publish in the papers the resolutions to which they had reached an accord.<note xml:id="239" display="no" n="1"></note> There was some indignation felt at the action of 
<persName xml:id="2325">Baumgarten</persName> in breaking away, &amp; letting out secrets.</p>
         <p>Then 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to Cambridge, &amp; put up at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's Lodge with the 
<persName xml:id="3259">Vice–Chancellor</persName>. The next day, <hi rend="bold underline">Sunday, the 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> May, I <ref xml:id="449">preached</ref> in the Chapel of Jesus College, &amp; afterwards to the University in Great S</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Mary's</hi>. There was a fair congregation of dons, but of under–graduates perhaps 50 or 60. Yet I was assured that this was far above the average attendance, so grievously has church–going declined in the University. After the sermon, we called on the 
<persName xml:id="757">Master of Trinity</persName>, and on 
<persName xml:id="573">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Burkitt</persName>. Then we had tea with 
<persName xml:id="1862">Prof. Bonney</persName>, who had collected a party to meet us, including 
<persName xml:id="1178">Clarence Stock</persName>. We attended Evensong in S. John's Chapel, and afterwards I dined in Hall. There I met 
<persName xml:id="2560"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Holland Rose</hi></persName>, the historian.</p>
         <p>On Monday we came away by the 9.45 express, having spent a very agreeable 'week–end'.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[421]</hi> [symbol]</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">
<persName xml:id="570">Edith Bruce</persName> died of heart failure, having had to endure a supplementary operation</hi>. The poor woman has been more or less languishing these many months since the former operation. My wife &amp; I travelled to 
<placeName xml:id="39" display="no">Fairlie</placeName> on the afternoon of Ascension Day (May 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1912), &amp; on the next day, I conducted the Funeral Service. The local Presbyterian minister offered a prayer before the coffin was carried out of the House. The cemetery at Langs is beautifully placed, on the slope of the cliff, commanding the loveliest views of the Great &amp; Little Cumbrae, with the distant Arran hills, &amp; the avenue of islands &amp; promontories which leads to the Kyles of Bute. We returned to London the same evening motoring with 
<persName xml:id="1549" display="no">Monty Parker</persName> to Kilmarnock, &amp; joining the Scotch Mail at Carlisle. We arrived at Euston at 3.50 p.m., &amp; at once drove home, &amp; went to bed.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">On Ascension Day, the 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> May, 1912, the 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> reading of the Welsh Disestablishment Bill was carried by a majority of 81</hi>, the final phase of the debate was marked by a characteristic outburst of the 
<persName xml:id="234">Chancellor</persName>, in which he fell upon the 
<persName xml:id="368">Duke of Devonshire</persName> with much ferocity. There is no real desire that the Bill should pass outside the ranks of the baser–sort of Nonconformist. But the log–rolling necessities of the Government carry it forward as it were automatically.</p>
