         <p><hi rend="bold underline">Baxter</hi> was himself the most prominent &amp; indefatigable of the preachers &amp; writers of the day.  It is evident that he felt himself the temptation to hypocrisy which both preaching &amp; writing involve: &amp; his own experience enabled him to divine the nature of the reigning humbug of that age of preachers &amp; writers.</p>
         <p>I celebrated alone at 8 a.m. &amp; sadly, thinking of

         <p>At Mattins the congregation was smaller than usual: possibly the reduction of travelling facilities may have contributed to this result.  The

         <p>I attended service in the Abbey at 3 p.m.  The Bishop (
<persName xml:id="280"><hi rend="bold underline">Boyd Carpenter</hi></persName>) preached.  His eloquence was of course astonishing, the flow of well–chosen &amp; well–arranged words being abundant &amp; facile: but there was little beside the words.  <hi rend="bold underline">It is an obsolete style of preaching – obsolete, I mean, among men of education, but it still prevails in the Dissenting pulpit, &amp; continues to be very popular</hi><hi rend="bold">.  </hi>The preacher takes the Bible at face value, &amp; moralizes at pleasure.</p>
